# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Sensory Withdrawal (Pratyahara)
Bhramari is a bridge between breath and meditation. The goal is to use sound to pull the attention away from external distractions.

## The Physiological North Star: Vibration > Volume
The efficacy comes from the vibration stimulating the nervous system. If the AI detects a 'forced' or 'loud' sound, it should cue for a softer, more subtle vibration.

## Transition Logic
Perfect for the end of a session or immediately before silent meditation.
