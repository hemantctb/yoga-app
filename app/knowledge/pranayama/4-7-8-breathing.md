# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Parasympathetic Induction
This is a 'chemical' breath. The ratio specifically triggers the vagus nerve.

## The Physiological North Star: 1:2 Inhale-Exhale Ratio
The 8-second exhale is the most important part. If the student exhales too fast, the effect is lost.

## Transition Logic
Best used before bed or during a panic attack.
