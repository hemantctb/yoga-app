# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Solar Activation
Surya Bhedana is for when the system is too 'cold' or 'heavy'. It's about intentional activation.

## The Physiological North Star: Pure Right-Side Intake
The critical element is inhaling ONLY through the right. Exhaling through the left is standard to complete the circuit, but the 'work' is in the intake.

## Transition Logic
Best used in the morning or when feeling sluggish. Not recommended before sleep.
