# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Tranquil Cooling
Sitali aims to extinguish heat—physical or emotional—through a moist, cool intake of air.

## The Physiological North Star: Moist Inhale > Speed
The focus is on the sensation of coolness on the tongue. The inhale should be slow and steady to maximize the cooling effect.

## Transition Logic
Perfect for hot weather, after intense asana, or when feeling frustrated.
