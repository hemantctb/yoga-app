# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Dynamic Vitality
Bhastrika is about building intense energy and heat through disciplined force.

## The Physiological North Star: Active Inhale & Exhale
Unlike Kapalabhati, both directions are active. The volume of air should be maximized while keeping the rhythm steady.

## Transition Logic
Used to wake up the system or before deep meditation to clear the Nadis.
