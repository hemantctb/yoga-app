# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Tactical Composure
Box breathing is for immediate stabilization. The AI should prioritize the 'pause' as much as the breath.

## The Physiological North Star: Absolute Equality
The effectiveness comes from the predictable, equal rhythm. If the AI detects one phase being shorter, it should cue for a more consistent count.

## Transition Logic
Can be used anywhere, anytime. Excellent for warming up before a presentation or settling in before a yoga class.
