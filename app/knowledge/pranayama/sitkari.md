# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Subduing Fire
Sitkari is the alternative to Sitali for those who cannot curl their tongue. The goal is identical: rapid cooling.

## The Physiological North Star: Air Moisture & Temperature
The air must be drawn in slowly to allow it to cool over the saliva.

## Transition Logic
Ideal for cooling down after a vigorous flow or in hot climates.
