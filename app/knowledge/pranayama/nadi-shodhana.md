# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Internal Equilibrium
Nadi Shodhana aims for absolute balance. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure silence of breath and a steady, rhythmic pace.

## The Physiological North Star: Effortless Flow > Long Retention
The non-negotiable rule is that the practitioner should never feel "breath hunger" or strain. If the AI detects gasping or facial tension, it should cue a shorter ratio.

## Transition Logic
Ideal after asana practice to settle the energy before meditation.
