# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Focused Vitality
Ujjayi aims to link the physical body with the mental state through a steady auditory anchor.

## The Physiological North Star: Smooth Sound > Volume
The sound should be audible only to the practitioner. If it sounds like snoring or gasping, the constriction is too tight.

## Transition Logic
Used throughout asana practice to maintain rhythm and heat.
