# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Internal Radiance
Kapalabhati aims to 'shine' the skull by removing toxins and mental clutter.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Abdominal Snap > Shoulder Movement
The shoulders and chest should remain still. The only movement is in the lower abdomen. If the AI detects shoulder heaving, it should cue a slower pace.

## Transition Logic
Best practiced early in the session to clear energy or before meditation.
