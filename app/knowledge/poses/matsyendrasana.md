cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Sit with one leg crossed over the other."
    - "Twist toward the top knee."
    - "Keep the spine long and chest open."
  foundation: 
    - "Root both sitting bones firmly; if one lifts, straighten the bottom leg."
    - "Place the top foot flat on the floor outside the opposite knee."
  alignment: 
    - "Inhale to grow tall before rotating; never twist into a collapsed spine."
    - "The back hand acts as a second spine—use it for height, not for leaning."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to create space between the vertebrae; exhale to spiral deeper from the navel upward."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Wringing Out
The vibe is detoxification and internal massage. The AI should look for 'slouching' or 'hunching' in the upper back, which indicates the twist is being forced rather than grown.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Axial Extension > Rotation
The non-negotiable is spinal height. If the student rounds the lumbar spine, the vertebrae compress during rotation, risking injury. The AI must prioritize 'Spine straight/Tall' over 'How far you turn.'

## Transition Logic
Commonly used at the end of a seated sequence to neutralize the spine after forward folds or as a deep opener for the hips and back. Always practice on both sides for equal duration.

## Inclusivity & Safety
**Crucial Warning:** Avoid deep twisting during pregnancy; offer a 'reverse' or 'open' twist (twisting away from the knee) to avoid belly compression. For those with spinal disc issues, keep the twist very mild and prioritize the vertical lift.
