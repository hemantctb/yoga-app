# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "One leg extended, the other bent with foot to inner thigh."
    - "Fold forward from the hips over the extended leg."
    - "Keep your spine long and chest open."
  foundation: 
    - "Root down through both sitting bones; sit on a blanket if one hip lifts."
    - "The sole of the bent foot presses gently into the inner thigh of the extended leg."
  alignment: 
    - "Square your torso over the extended leg before folding."
    - "Lead with the heart, maintaining length in the spine."
    - "Micro-bend the extended knee if hamstrings are tight."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen, exhale to deepen the fold."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["pain", "force", "round back", "lock knee"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Touch your head to your knee."
      elevated: "Draw the crown of the head toward the extended foot, allowing the spine to release and lengthen with each exhalation."

    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Place hands on the student's hips, ensuring both sitting bones remain grounded. Gently guide the torso to square over the extended leg."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing on the bent knee; prioritize knee comfort and safety."

    type: "traction"
    instruction: "Place one hand on the sacrum and the other lightly on the upper back, encouraging axial extension on the exhale."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student is not rounding the lower back excessively; emphasize length over depth."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Internal Reflection & Hamstring/Groin Release
This pose aims to calm the mind while providing a deep stretch to the hamstring and groin of the extended leg. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize spinal length, hip flexibility, and a gentle, non-forced approach to the forward fold.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip Hinging & Knee Safety
The non-negotiable rule is to fold from the hips, not the lower back, and to protect the knee of the extended leg. If the AI detects excessive lumbar rounding or hyperextension of the extended knee, it should suggest bending the knee, sitting on a blanket, or using a strap to maintain spinal integrity.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Dandasana or other seated preparations. It is often followed by a neutral seated pose or other seated forward bends. Always practice on both sides for equal duration.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For individuals with tight hamstrings, a micro-bend in the extended knee is crucial. For knee sensitivity in the bent leg, ensure the foot is not pressing too hard into the inner thigh, or place a blanket under the knee.
