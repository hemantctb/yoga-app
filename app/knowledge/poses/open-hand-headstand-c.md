# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Inverted Forward Fold & Hamstring Release
Mukta Hasta Sirsasana C aims for a deep inverted forward fold from a wide-legged position, challenging balance and core strength while intensely stretching the hamstrings and adductors. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck and shoulder safety, emphasize strong hand and core engagement, and encourage a controlled, gradual forward fold.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Base & Core Engagement > Fold Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a strong, stable base with the hands and to use core and shoulder strength for stability. If the AI detects instability, neck strain, or improper hand/head placement, it should immediately prompt the student to lower down and reassess, or practice against a wall. The depth of the forward fold is secondary to safety.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Mukta Hasta Sirsasana B. It is often a final expression before returning to a grounded pose or Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced inversion and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute neck, shoulder, or spinal injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during menstruation/pregnancy. Always learn from a qualified teacher and use a wall for safety.
