# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Hamstring Length & Arm Balance Strength
Tittibhasana A aims to combine extreme hamstring flexibility with significant upper body and core strength in an arm balance. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure wrist and hip safety, emphasize strong arm and core engagement, and encourage a controlled extension of the legs.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Strong Base & Hamstring Length > Leg Height/Straightness
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a strong, stable base with the hands and to have sufficient hamstring and inner thigh flexibility to straighten the legs without rounding the spine. If the AI detects instability, wrist strain, or excessive spinal rounding, it should prompt the student to lower down, use blocks for hand support, or work on preparatory poses.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Bhujapidasana, building on similar arm balance principles. It is a preparatory pose for Tittibhasana B and C.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced arm balance and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with any wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, or hamstring injuries. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely. Listen to the body, and do not force entry.
