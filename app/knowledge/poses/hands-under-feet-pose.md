# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Release & Spinal Length
This pose is about a profound opening of the entire back body, with a specific focus on hamstring flexibility and spinal decompression. The AI should look for cues that facilitate a deep, passive stretch rather than an aggressive pull.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip Hinging over Lumbar Rounding
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the lower back by maintaining the natural curve and initiating the fold from the hips. If the AI detects a rounded lower back, it should suggest bending the knees more deeply or releasing the hands to blocks.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Big Toe Pose or other standing warm-ups. It is often followed by a Half Forward Bend (Ardha Uttanasana) to re-lengthen the spine before moving into other standing or seated poses.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For individuals with tight hamstrings, significant knee bending is encouraged. For wrist sensitivity, a shallower fold or holding blocks is advised to reduce pressure on the wrists.
