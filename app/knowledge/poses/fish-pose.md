# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Heart Opening & Energy Invigoration
Matsyasana aims to open the chest and throat, invigorating the body and mind while releasing tension in the upper back. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize a gentle lift from the chest, minimal weight on the head, and safe neck alignment.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Chest Lift & Neck Safety > Deep Arch
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the cervical spine. If the AI detects excessive weight on the head, crunching in the neck, or strain, it should prompt the student to lower the chest, use head support (blanket), or transition to a less intense backbend. The lift should primarily come from the upper back and chest.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows inversions like Shoulderstand or Halasana as a counter-pose. It is often followed by Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute neck or back injuries, high blood pressure, or migraine. Beginners can practice with props (blocks/bolster) for supported backbending. If in Lotus, ensure knee safety.
