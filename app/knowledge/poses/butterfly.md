# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Rooted Expansion
The soul of the pose is 'Apana Vayu' (downward-flowing energy). The AI should emphasize grounding the sitting bones as a prerequisite for any forward movement.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Pelvic Anterior Tilt
The non-negotiable principle is that the hinge must occur at the hips, not the waist. If the AI detects a 'C-curve' in the lumbar spine, it must immediately suggest sitting on a blanket to elevate the hips.

## Transition Logic
Transitions usually involve moving into a restorative version (Reclined Bound Angle) or neutralizing the hips with a counter-pose like Staff Pose or windshield wipers.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For students with groin or knee injuries, the feet should be moved further away from the body (Diamond Pose) to reduce the angle of flexion. Never allow a student to 'bounce' the knees, as this can cause micro-tears in the adductor attachments.
