# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Internal Sanctuary
The pose is about safety and reset. The AI should prioritize detecting signs of 'struggle' (shoulders up by ears, shallow breathing) and cue toward 'softening.'

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Release
The non-negotiable is that the spine must be allowed to round and decompress. If the hips are significantly elevated from the heels due to tightness, the AI must suggest props (blanket between calves and thighs) to allow the nervous system to let go.



## Transition Logic
Child’s pose is the 'home base.' Transitions should be slow. Moving into Table Top requires a manual 're-stacking' of the vertebrae or a forward slide of the heart.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Essential for pregnancy (knees wide) and those with knee injuries (use a rolled blanket behind the knee crease to create space in the joint). For shoulder injuries, always recommend arms back by the sides.
