# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Effortless Presence
The essence of Sukhasana is 'Sthira Sukham'—the balance of effort and ease. The AI should look for 'collapsing' in the chest or 'fidgeting' in the legs, which suggests physical discomfort.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Neutral Pelvis
The non-negotiable is the elimination of posterior pelvic tilt (rounding the lower back). If the hips are below the knees, the lower back will round. The AI must insist on 'Hips Above Knees' via props to protect the lumbar spine.

## Transition Logic
Sukhasana is the universal transition pose between active movement and stillness. It is the primary 'starting' and 'ending' seat for breathwork (Pranayama).

## Inclusivity & Safety
For students with chronic knee issues, suggest extending one leg or sitting in a chair. For those with lower back pain, the wall serves as an excellent prop to provide feedback for vertical alignment.
