# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "From Reclining Big Toe Pose A, open the lifted leg to the side."
    - "Keep the opposite hip grounded."
    - "Maintain a straight leg and a long spine."
  foundation: 
    - "Ensure the entire spine remains grounded on the mat, especially the sacrum."
    - "Actively press the outer hip of the grounded leg down to prevent rolling."
  alignment: 
    - "Allow the lifted leg to open to the side, maintaining its straightness."
    - "Keep the shoulders relaxed and avoid tension in the neck."
    - "Gaze toward the nose-tip or close your eyes for deeper introspection."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to maintain length, exhale to allow the leg to open further to the side."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["force", "pain", "lift hip", "crunch back"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Drop your leg to the side."
      elevated: "Invite the inner thigh to release and lengthen, allowing the lifted leg to descend gradually toward the earth."

    title: "Inner Thigh Release"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand at the student's lifted leg. Place one hand on the inner thigh (near the knee) and gently encourage the leg to open further to the side on an exhale."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing directly on the knee joint; communicate about intensity and any sharp pain."

    title: "Opposite Hip Grounding"
    type: "grounding"
    instruction: "Place a flat palm on the ASIS (hip bone) of the grounded leg to prevent the pelvis from tilting or lifting."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student's lower back remains grounded; avoid any arching."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Inner Thigh Release with Spinal Grounding
Supta Padangustasana B aims for an intense yet controlled stretch of the inner thighs and groins while keeping the spine safely grounded. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize pelvic stability, knee safety, and a gradual, controlled approach to opening the hip.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Grounding & Pelvic Stability > Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to keep the entire spine and the opposite hip grounded on the mat. If the AI detects the pelvis tilting or lifting, it should suggest bending the lifted knee slightly, using a strap, or not extending the leg as far to the side, prioritizing pelvic stability and spinal integrity.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Reclining Big Toe Pose A. It is often followed by other supine postures or a transition to Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For individuals with tight inner thighs or hamstrings, using a strap is highly recommended. For lower back sensitivity, ensure the grounded leg is actively pressing down. Avoid if there are acute groin, hamstring, or hip injuries.
