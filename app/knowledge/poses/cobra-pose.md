# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Buoyant Heart
The vibe is rising with grace. The AI should look for 'heaviness' in the hands (meaning the back isn't working) and 'tension' in the neck.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Lower Back Integrity
The non-negotiable is preventing 'crunching' in the L4-L5 lumbar region. If the AI detects the student is pushing into straight arms with a collapsed lower back, it must trigger a 'Baby Cobra' modification.

## Transition Logic
Commonly paired with the 'Vinyasa' flow (Plank -> Chaturanga -> Cobra). Ensure the student maintains the 'hug' of the elbows during the transition to protect the rotator cuffs.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Critical for students with disc herniations: keep it to a 'Baby Cobra' where the navel stays on the floor. For pregnancy, Cobra should be avoided after the first trimester in favor of 'Cow Pose' or seated heart openers to avoid abdominal pressure.
