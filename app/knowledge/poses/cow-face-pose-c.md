# IDENTITY
names:
  sanskrit: "Gomukhasana C"
  english: "Cow Face Pose C"
  phonetic: "go-moo-KAHS-ah-nah C"

# HERO DESCRIPTION
description: "The most intricate variation of Cow Face Pose, adding a deep spinal twist to the stacked knees and shoulder bind. It enhances spinal mobility, stimulates abdominal organs, and offers a profound release of tension from the hips, shoulders, and back."

# PROPS & GUIDANCE
props: ["strap", "blanket"]
prop_guidance:
  - prop: "strap"
    purpose: "Shoulder Bind Assistance"
    instruction: "Use a strap to bridge the gap between your hands if you cannot comfortably clasp them behind your back during the shoulder bind."
  - prop: "blanket"
    purpose: "Pelvic Elevation"
    instruction: "Sit on a folded blanket to elevate the hips, making it easier to stack the knees and allowing for a longer spine in the twist."

# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "From Gomukhasana A, twist toward the top knee (or opposite)."
    - "Maintain the knee stack and shoulder bind."
    - "Keep the spine long and gaze over back shoulder."
  foundation: 
    - "Ensure both sitting bones are equally grounded, adjusting hips or using a blanket if needed."
    - "Maintain the integrity of the knee stack; do not force the top knee down."
  alignment: 
    - "Inhale to lengthen the spine, then exhale to initiate the twist from the lower abdomen."
    - "Use the arm (if not bound) as leverage against the knee to deepen the twist."
    - "Keep the shoulders relaxed and drawn down the back, even with the bind."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen, exhale to deepen the twist and release tension."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["force knees", "pain", "round back", "shrug shoulders"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Twist hard."
      elevated: "Invite a spiraling rotation from the core, allowing the torso to wring out and detoxify with each exhalation, mindful of spinal integrity and shoulder mobility."

# ASSISTS (Hands-On)
assists:
  - id: "cow-face-pose-c-hip-release"
    title: "Pelvic Engagement & Release"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand behind the student. Place hands on the outer hips and gently encourage the top knee to settle down, aligning the pelvis."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing directly on the knee joint; communicate about intensity and any sharp pain."
  - id: "cow-face-pose-c-spinal-rotation"
    title: "Torso Revolve"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Place one hand on the sacrum for grounding and the other on the mid-back (scapula area) to encourage a deeper spinal rotation on the exhale."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student is not compressing their lower back; encourage length before depth."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Hip/Shoulder Opening & Spinal Detoxification
Gomukhasana C integrates a deep hip and shoulder opening with a profound spinal twist, aiming for enhanced mobility and internal organ stimulation. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee and shoulder safety, mindful progression into the twist and bind, and maintaining spinal length.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Hip Safety > Depth of Twist
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee joints from strain. If the AI detects knee pain, excessive hip tilting, forced shoulder binding, or spinal compression, it should prompt the student to use props (blanket, block, strap) or reduce the intensity of the hip stack or twist.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Gomukhasana B. It is often followed by other seated variations or a return to Dandasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, hip, or shoulder injuries. Use props generously to support the hips and knees. Never force the knees to stack or the body into the twist if there is pain. Avoid deep twists during pregnancy.
