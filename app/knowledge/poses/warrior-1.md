## The Semantic Goal: Opposing Forces
The dual action of **Grounding and Rising**. Cues should address the heavy back heel versus the light, reaching heart.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Functional Squaring
Prioritize the rotation of the torso and stability of the SI joint over forcing 'square' hips.

## Transition Logic
- **Rise on Inhale:** Ensure the movement from the low lunge to the upright warrior is timed with the inhalation.
