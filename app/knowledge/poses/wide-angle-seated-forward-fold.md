# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Inner Thigh & Hamstring Release with Spinal Extension
This pose aims to deeply stretch the inner thighs and hamstrings while maintaining a long, decompressed spine. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage hip hinging, knee safety, and a gentle, non-forced approach to the deep stretch.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip Hinging & Knee Safety > Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knees and lower back. If the AI detects excessive lumbar rounding, hyperextension of the knees, or pain in the groin, it should suggest bending the knees, sitting on a blanket, or using props (bolster for torso, strap for feet).

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Dandasana or other seated hip openers. It is often followed by Supta Konasana (Reclining Angle Pose) or other seated forward folds.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For individuals with tight hamstrings or inner thighs, a micro-bend in the knees is crucial, and sitting on a blanket is highly recommended. Avoid if there are acute groin, hamstring, or lower back injuries.
