# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Full Back Body Strengthening & Endurance
Nakrasana aims to build strength and endurance throughout the entire back body and core in a dynamic prone backbend. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage active engagement of the glutes and hamstrings, a strong back lift, and maintaining length in the spine to protect the lower back.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length & Core Engagement > Lift Height
The non-negotiable rule is to lift evenly through the upper and lower body, protecting the lumbar spine from compression. If the AI detects pinching in the lower back, lack of leg engagement, or strain in the neck, it should prompt the student to reduce the lift, adjust alignment, or return to a simpler backbend.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory backbends like Locust Pose or Cobra Pose. It is often followed by Child's Pose as a counter-stretch or Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute back or neck injuries, high blood pressure, or abdominal issues. Modifications can include lifting only the upper body (Cobra) or only the legs (Locust). Always listen to the body and avoid any sharp pain.
