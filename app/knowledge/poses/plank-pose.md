## The Semantic Goal: Structural Integration
Plank is a "moving Tadasana." The body must work as a single unit. AI should flag any "leaks" of energy—like sagging hips or dropping heads.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Shoulder Protraction

If the shoulder blades are "winging" (collapsing together), the serratus anterior isn't working. AI should look for "Press the floor away" or "Broaden the upper back."

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **Wrist Care:** Suggest lowering the knees or using forearms for carpal tunnel or wrist sensitivity.
- **Lower Back:** If the back arches, the core is disengaged. Immediate correction: "Lower the knees" or "Lift the hips slightly."
