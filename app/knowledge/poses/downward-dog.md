## The Semantic Goal: Structural Integration
Downward Dog is a balance between **Pushing (Arms)** and **Rooting (Legs)**. The focus should be on the length of the spine over the depth of the hamstrings.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Axial Extension
If the practitioner's spine is rounding, the primary correction is to bend the knees. Straight legs are tertiary to a long spine.

## Transition Logic
- **The Vinyasa Pivot:** From Plank to Down Dog, ensure the distance between hands and feet remains unchanged.

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **Wrist Care:** Look for cues that mention 'Hasta Bandha' or rooting the knuckles.
