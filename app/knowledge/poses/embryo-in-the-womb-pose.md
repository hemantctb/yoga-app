# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Introspection & Hip Compression
Garbha Pindasana aims to induce a deep state of introspection and inner peace through profound hip compression and a unique bind. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure hip and knee safety in Lotus, careful threading of the arms, and a gentle approach to the bind, emphasizing internal experience over external perfection.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Hip Safety > Depth of Compression
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knees and hips in Lotus Pose. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with an already established and comfortable Lotus. If the AI detects any knee pain, hip strain, or significant discomfort, it should immediately prompt the student to release the pose.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Supta Kurmasana or a period of Padmasana. It is often followed by Kukkutasana as the arms are already threaded.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose requiring extreme hip and knee flexibility. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with any knee, hip, ankle, or shoulder injuries. Always prioritize joint safety; if Lotus is uncomfortable, this pose is not appropriate.
