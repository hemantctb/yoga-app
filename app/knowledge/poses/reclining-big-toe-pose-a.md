# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Gentle Hamstring Release with Spinal Grounding
Supta Padangustasana A aims for a safe and effective hamstring stretch while maintaining a grounded spine. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize spinal grounding, knee safety, and a gradual, controlled approach to deepening the stretch.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Grounding & Knee Safety > Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to keep the entire spine, especially the lower back, grounded on the mat. If the AI detects the lower back lifting, it should suggest bending the lifted knee slightly, using a strap, or not drawing the leg in as far.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Savasana or other supine preparations. It is often followed by Reclining Big Toe Pose B or other leg stretches.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For individuals with tight hamstrings, using a strap is highly recommended. For lower back sensitivity, keep the grounded leg bent with the foot on the floor. Always maintain active quadriceps in both legs to protect the knee joints.
