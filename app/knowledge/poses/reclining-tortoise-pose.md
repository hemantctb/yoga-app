# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Ultimate Surrender & Internalization
Supta Kurmasana is about drawing all senses inward, achieving a deep state of surrender and introspection. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize physical release, mental quietude, and extreme caution due to the pose's intensity.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip Mobility & Spinal Safety > Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the hips, knees, and spine. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with highly developed flexibility. If the AI detects any strain, sharp pain, or inability to breathe freely, it should immediately prompt a release from the pose and suggest less intense alternatives.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Kurmasana. It is a peak pose in its own right, often followed by a transition to Garbha Pindasana or a gentle neutralizing counter-pose.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an extremely advanced pose and is not suitable for most practitioners, especially those with any hip, knee, ankle, shoulder, or spinal issues. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely. Listen to the body, and do not force entry into the bind or the full expression of the pose.
