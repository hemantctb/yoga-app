# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Surrender & Hip/Hamstring Opening
Kurmasana is about deep introspection and surrender, achieved through an intense forward fold that targets the hamstrings and hips. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage spinal length, hip hinging, and a gentle, non-forced approach to the deep stretch.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length & Knee Safety
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a long spine and protect the knees from strain. If the AI detects excessive lumbar rounding or hyperextension of the knees, it should suggest bending the knees more, sitting on a blanket, or reducing the depth of the forward fold.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory seated hip openers like Upavistha Konasana or Paschimottanasana. It is often followed by its reclining variation, Supta Kurmasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose and requires significant hamstring and hip flexibility. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute lower back, knee, or hip injuries. Always listen to the body and prioritize comfort and safety over achieving the full expression.
