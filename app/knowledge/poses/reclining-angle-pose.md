# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Passive Hamstring/Groin Stretch
Supta Konasana aims for an intense yet passive stretch of the inner thighs and hamstrings while keeping the spine safely grounded. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize spinal grounding, knee safety, and a gentle, gradual approach to deepening the stretch.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Grounding & Knee Safety > Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to keep the entire spine, especially the lower back, grounded on the mat. If the AI detects the lower back lifting, it should suggest bending the knees, using a strap, or reducing the outward extension of the legs to protect the lumbar spine.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows seated wide-angle forward folds (Upavistha Konasana) or other hamstring stretches. It is often followed by other supine postures or a transition to Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose requiring significant hamstring and inner thigh flexibility. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute lower back, hip, or hamstring injuries. Always listen to the body and prioritize comfort and safety over achieving the full expression. Use props generously.
