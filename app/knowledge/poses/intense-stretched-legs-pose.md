# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Core Strengthening & Pelvic Stability
Uttana Padasana aims to build strong core muscles and stabilize the pelvis, particularly focusing on the lower abdominals and hip flexors. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize maintaining a grounded lower back, deep core engagement, and controlled leg movement.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Lumbar Grounding > Leg Height
The non-negotiable rule is to keep the entire lumbar spine pressed into the floor. If the AI detects any arching in the lower back, it should prompt the student to lower their legs, bend their knees, or reduce the angle of the lift to protect the spine. The height of the legs is secondary to spinal integrity.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Savasana or other supine preparations. It is often integrated into sequences to build core strength or can be held for longer periods as a meditative posture.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute lower back pain. For beginners, lifting the legs with bent knees or only lifting one leg at a time can be good modifications. Ensure there is no strain in the neck; if so, gently tuck the chin towards the chest.
