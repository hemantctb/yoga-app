  phonetic: "gah-roo-DAHS-ah-nah"

# HERO DESCRIPTION
description: "A complex standing balance that requires total concentration and a multi-dimensional squeeze of the limbs toward the midline. It serves as a powerful metaphor for sharp focus and the unwinding of physical and mental tension."

    - "Hydrates the joints through a 'tourniquet effect' in the hips, knees, and shoulders."
  mental: 
    - "Builds one-pointed concentration and calms the nervous system."

  - prop: "block"
    purpose: "Balance Kickstand"
    instruction: "Place a block on the outside of the standing foot to rest the toes of the wrapping leg if the double-wrap is not accessible."
  - prop: "wall"
    purpose: "Postural Feedback"
    instruction: "Lean the back against a wall to focus on the leg wrap and arm alignment without the challenge of free-standing balance."

    - "Sit deep into a one-legged chair and cross your right leg over the left."
    - "Squeeze your inner thighs and forearms together."
  foundation: 
    - "Spread the toes of the standing foot wide and root through the four corners."
    - "Sink the hips low before initiating the wrap of the legs."
  alignment: 
    - "Stack the elbows and knees in one vertical line along the midline of the body."
    - "Lift the elbows to shoulder height while drawing the shoulder blades down the back."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to broaden the back of the lungs between the shoulder blades; exhale to sit deeper and compress toward the center."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["tangle", "knot", "clench"]
  elevated_vocabulary:

    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Standing behind the student, place hands on the hips and gently guide the wrapping-side hip back to square the pelvis forward."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student's standing knee is tracking forward and not collapsing inward."
  - id: "eagle-pose-shoulders-grounding"
    title: "Scapular Release"
    type: "grounding"
    instruction: "Lightly press the student's shoulders down away from the ears while they maintain the lift of the elbows."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing on the cervical spine or the joints of the elbows."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Fierce Focus
Eagle pose is about 'The Squeeze.' The vibe is a laser-like focus that cuts through distraction. The AI should look for 'wandering eyes' or 'wobbling' and cue for a return to the breath and a fixed drishti.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Midline Compression
The non-negotiable rule is the integration of the limbs toward the midline. If the elbows or knees drift away from the center, the balance and the joint-cleansing effect are compromised. The AI must prioritize 'Squeeze to Center > Depth of Sit.'

## Transition Logic
Commonly transitioned from Chair Pose. Because it involves deep compression, it is usually followed by a 'release' pose like Mountain Pose or an expansive Standing Forward Bend to allow blood to flush back into the joints.

## Inclusivity & Safety
**Critical Warning:** This pose places significant pressure on the knees and ankles. If a student has a meniscus injury, they should skip the leg wrap and simply cross the thighs. For those with rotator cuff issues, 'Hug the Shoulders' instead of wrapping the forearms.
