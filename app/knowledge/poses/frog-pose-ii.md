# IDENTITY
names:
  sanskrit: "Bhekasana"
  english: "Frog Pose II"
  phonetic: "bek-AHS-ah-nah"

# HERO DESCRIPTION
description: "A deep prone backbend that provides an intense stretch for the quadriceps, hip flexors, and ankles. It opens the chest and shoulders, stimulating abdominal organs and building heat, while challenging flexibility and mental endurance."

# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Lie on your belly, bend knees, grab inner arches of feet."
    - "Press feet down towards hips, lift chest."
    - "Keep elbows pointing upward, shoulders away from ears."
  foundation: 
    - "Ensure hips remain grounded on the mat; avoid lifting one side excessively."
    - "Press the pubic bone gently into the floor to lengthen the lower back."
  alignment: 
    - "Keep the knees hip-width apart; avoid splaying them too wide."
    - "Draw shoulder blades down the back, lifting the chest forward and up."
    - "Gaze forward or down to maintain a long neck."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to expand the chest, exhale to deepen the quadriceps stretch."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["pain", "force", "crunch lower back", "lock knees"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Push your feet to your butt."
      elevated: "Invite the heels to descend toward the outer hips, allowing for a profound release in the quadriceps and hip flexors."

# ASSISTS (Hands-On)
assists:
  - id: "frog-pose-ii-quad-stretch"
    title: "Quadriceps Release"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand at the student's feet. Place hands on the tops of the feet (near the ankles) and gently encourage the heels closer to the hips."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing directly on the knee joint; communicate about intensity and any sharp pain."
  - id: "frog-pose-ii-pelvic-grounding"
    title: "Sacral Stabilization"
    type: "grounding"
    instruction: "Place a flat palm on the sacrum and apply gentle downward pressure to keep the pelvis grounded, preventing it from lifting."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student's lower back is not compressing; encourage length in the spine."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Quadriceps & Hip Flexor Release
Bhekasana aims for an intense and deep stretch of the quadriceps and hip flexors, combined with a backbend. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee safety, mindful progression into the stretch, and proper lower back alignment.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee Safety & Even Hip Grounding > Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee joints from strain and to keep both hips grounded and level. If the AI detects knee pain, lifting of one hip, or compression in the lower back, it should suggest modifying the pose (e.g., using a blanket under knees, reducing the depth of the leg bend).

## Transition Logic
Typically follows prone backbends like Locust Pose or Cobra Pose. It is often followed by Child's Pose as a counter-stretch or Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose requiring significant quadriceps and hip flexibility. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute knee, ankle, hip, or lower back injuries. Always use proper knee cushioning (blanket) and listen to the body for any signs of strain.
