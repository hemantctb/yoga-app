# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Hip Opening & Inverted Balance
Urdhva Padmasana aims to combine the deep hip opening of Lotus with the benefits of inversion, demanding significant flexibility, strength, and balance. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck and knee safety, a stable shoulderstand foundation, and gradual, mindful progression into the Lotus bind.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Neck & Knee Safety > Lotus Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the cervical spine and the knees. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with a comfortable Shoulderstand and a pain-free Lotus Pose. If the AI detects any neck pain, knee strain, or instability, it should immediately prompt the student to release the Lotus or come out of the inversion.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Salamba Sarvangasana (Shoulderstand) and precedes Pindasana (Embryo Pose). It requires a controlled and mindful transition from Shoulderstand into Lotus.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced inversion and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute neck, shoulder, knee, or hip injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during pregnancy. Always use blankets under the shoulders to protect the neck. Never turn the head in this pose.
