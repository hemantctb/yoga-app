    - "Extend the back leg straight behind you, neutral and not turned out."
  alignment: 
    - "Ensure weight is distributed evenly; do not collapse onto the hip of the bent leg."
    - "Keep the back leg internally rotated so the kneecap faces the floor."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lift the chest and find space in the spine; exhale to walk the hands forward, melting into the stretch."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Conscious Surrender
Pigeon is the ultimate "truth-telling" pose. The AI should focus on the student's ability to remain still amidst high sensation, looking for jaw clenching or breath-holding as signs of over-exertion.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Squaring > Shin Parallel
The non-negotiable is a square pelvis. A common mistake is forcing the front shin parallel to the front of the mat, which often causes the knee to twist or the hips to tilt. The AI must prioritize "Hips Square to Floor" over "Shin Parallel."

## Transition Logic
Usually entered from Downward-Dog or Three-Legged Dog. It is a peak hip-opener often followed by neutralizing poses like Downward-Dog (pedaling the feet) or seated counter-twists.

## Inclusivity & Safety
**Crucial:** If a student feels any sharp pain in the front knee, they must immediately transition to "Thread the Needle" (Reclined Figure Four) on their back. For pregnancy, use blocks under the hands to keep the torso elevated and avoid belly compression.
