# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Inverted Balance & Nervous System Calm
Salamba Sarvangasana aims to provide a calming inversion that improves circulation and gently stimulates the thyroid gland. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck and shoulder safety, emphasize core engagement for stability, and encourage a controlled, gradual entry and exit.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Neck Safety & Stable Base > Vertical Legs
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the cervical spine. If the AI detects neck compression, lifting of the shoulders, or an inability to breathe freely, it should immediately prompt the student to lower down and reassess, or use more blankets under the shoulders. The weight must be on the shoulders, not the neck.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Halasana (Plow Pose). It is often followed by Halasana again or Fish Pose as a counter-pose, and then Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an intermediate inversion and should be approached with caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute neck, shoulder, or spinal injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during menstruation/pregnancy. Always learn from a qualified teacher and use blankets for neck support. Never turn the head in this pose.
