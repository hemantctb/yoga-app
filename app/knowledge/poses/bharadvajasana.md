# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Gentle Spinal Twist & Hip Opening
Bharadvajasana aims for a gentle spinal twist, improving mobility and aiding digestion, while also offering a subtle hip opener. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage spinal length, mindful twisting from the core, and maintaining grounded sitting bones.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length > Twist Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a long, neutral spine throughout the twist. If the AI detects rounding in the back or discomfort, it should suggest sitting on a blanket to elevate the hips, thereby enabling a longer spine. The depth of the twist is secondary to spinal integrity.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Dandasana or Sukhasana. It is often followed by other seated postures or seated forward bends. Always practice on both sides for equal duration.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, hip, or spinal injuries. Sit on a blanket to ease pressure on the hips and knees. Avoid deep twists during pregnancy.
