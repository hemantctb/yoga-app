# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Flight
The "vibe" of Locust is an upward surge of energy. It is about overcoming the weight of the physical body through the sheer strength of the back and the expansion of the breath.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Posterior Chain Integration
The non-negotiable rule is the **synchronous engagement of the legs and spine**. If the legs lift too high without the chest following, it creates a hinge point in the lumbar spine. Height must be secondary to even extension throughout the entire back.

## Transition Logic
Locust is often used as a strengthening warm-up for more intense backbends like Bow Pose (Dhanurasana). It transitions effectively into a counter-stretch in *Child's Pose* or into *Downward-Dog* via a push-up or transition through all-fours.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For lower back sensitivity, lift only the chest while keeping the feet grounded, or lift the legs one at a time. Avoid this pose during the later stages of pregnancy due to the prone position and pressure on the abdomen.
