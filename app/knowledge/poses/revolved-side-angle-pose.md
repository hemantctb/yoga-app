# HERO DESCRIPTION
description: "A dynamic standing twist that deeply integrates the lower body foundation with a powerful spinal rotation. It strengthens the core, stretches the side body, and detoxifies the internal organs."

# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Start in a lunge, bring opposite elbow to front knee."
    - "Twist your torso, keeping your spine long."
    - "Reach the top arm to the sky or over your ear."
  foundation: 
    - "Back heel can be lifted or grounded at a 45-degree angle (if grounded, square hips as much as possible)."
    - "Front knee stacked directly over the ankle."
  alignment: 
    - "Press the bottom elbow into the outer thigh to leverage the twist."
    - "Stack the top shoulder directly over the bottom shoulder."
    - "Maintain a long line of energy from the back heel through the crown of the head."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen the spine, exhale to deepen the twist from the navel."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["crunch", "collapse", "force", "round back"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Twist harder."
      elevated: "Invite a spiraling action from the abdominal wall, allowing the torso to revolve around its central axis."

# ASSISTS (Hands-On)
assists:
  - id: "revolved-side-angle-hips-squaring"
    title: "Hip Stabilization"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Stand behind the student. Place hands on the hips, gently guiding the front hip back and the back hip forward to square the pelvis as much as possible."
    safety_check: "Avoid if the student has knee sensitivity; prioritize knee safety over hip squaring."
  - id: "revolved-side-angle-spine-rotation"
    title: "Torso Revolve"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Place one hand on the sacrum for grounding and the other on the mid-back (scapula area) to encourage a deeper spinal rotation on the exhale."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student is not compressing their lower back; encourage length before depth."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Spiraling Energy & Detoxification
Revolved Side Angle is about wringing out the internal organs and building internal heat. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize length in the spine before twisting, and deep, conscious breathing to facilitate the detoxification process.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length > Twist Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a long, neutral spine throughout the twist. If the AI detects rounding in the back, it should suggest using a block under the hand or lessening the depth of the twist, prioritizing spinal integrity over how far the student can turn.

## Transition Logic
Commonly follows Extended Side Angle or Warrior I. It is often a preparatory pose for deeper twists or arm balances. Transition out by unwinding the torso, then stepping back to Downward-Dog or rising to Warrior II.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Avoid deep twists during pregnancy; offer an open twist (twisting away from the front leg) or other modifications. For knee issues, ensure the front knee tracks directly over the ankle and avoid excessive hip squaring if it strains the knee.
