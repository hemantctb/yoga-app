# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Ultimate Front Body Release & Backbend Integration with Bind
Supta Urdhvapada Vajrasana B aims for an extremely deep, full-body backbend that intensely stretches the quadriceps, hip flexors, and abdomen, while integrating a profound shoulder and arm bind. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee, ankle, neck, and shoulder safety, mindful progression into the backbend, and proper spinal alignment, given the extreme nature of the pose.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Ankle Safety > Depth of Backbend
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee and ankle joints from strain. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with highly developed flexibility and an established practice of the previous variations. If the AI detects knee or ankle pain, pinching in the lower back or neck, or strain in the shoulders, it should prompt the student to back off, use modifications (e.g., bolster support), or practice preparatory stretches.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Supta Urdhvapada Vajrasana A. It is often a penultimate pose before Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an extremely advanced pose and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, ankle, hip, neck, or back injuries, or shoulder limitations. Always use proper cushioning (blanket) and listen to the body for any signs of strain.
