# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Inhale: Drop the belly, lift the gaze."
    - "Exhale: Round the back, tuck the chin."
    - "Move with the natural rhythm of your breath."
  foundation: 
    - "Start in Table Top: Wrists under shoulders, knees under hips."
    - "Press firmly through the palms and the tops of the feet."
  alignment: 
    - "On the Inhale (Cow), pull the heart through the gateway of the arms."
    - "On the Exhale (Cat), push the floor away and broaden the shoulder blades."
  breath_instruction: "Initiate every movement from the tailbone. Let the breath lead the spine into its next shape."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["crunch", "snap", "jerk"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Arch your back."
      elevated: "Open your chest and lift your tailbone towards the sky."

    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "During the exhale, place hands on the student's shoulder blades and gently guide them away from the spine."
    safety_check: "Apply light pressure; ensure the student is not locking their elbows."
  - id: "cat-cow-sacrum-traction"
    title: "Sacrum Traction (Cow)"
    type: "traction"

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Spinal Wave
The essence is fluidity. The AI should look for 'stuttering' movements or a lack of synchronization between the breath and the physical peak of the arch/round.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Segmental Articulation
The non-negotiable is that the movement should ripple through the vertebrae. The AI should flag 'blocky' movement where the whole back moves as one rigid unit instead of a wave.

## Transition Logic
Cat-Cow is the ultimate 'reset' or warm-up. It transitions seamlessly into Downward-Dog by tucking the toes and lifting the hips, or into Plank by stepping the feet back.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For students with wrist injuries, suggest 'fists for wrists' or Table Top on forearms. For neck sensitivity, cue the student to keep the gaze neutral (looking at the floor) even during Cow Pose.
