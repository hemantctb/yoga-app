# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Hamstring Length & Core Balance
Ubhaya Padangustasana is about finding a delicate balance between deep hamstring flexibility and strong core engagement. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage spinal length, core stability, and a gradual, controlled extension of the legs.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length & Sitting Bone Balance > Leg Height
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a long, straight spine, balancing precisely on the sitting bones. If the AI detects rounding in the back, rolling onto the tailbone, or a struggle to maintain balance, it should suggest bending the knees, using a strap, or practicing a preparatory pose like Navasana.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Navasana or other seated core work. It often transitions into Urdhva Mukha Paschimottanasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute hamstring, hip, or lower back injuries. Using a strap is highly recommended for those with tight hamstrings. Beginners should work on Navasana and Paschimottanasana before attempting this pose.
