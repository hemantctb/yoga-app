# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Radical Expansion
The vibe of Wheel Pose is "The Sun." It is a 360-degree radiation of power. The practitioner should feel a sense of vulnerability transformed into strength through the opening of the front body.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Equal Distribution of Curve
The non-negotiable rule is **Uniform Extension**. The AI must ensure the "bend" is distributed across the thoracic spine and hips, rather than "hinging" or "crunching" at the L5-S1 lumbar junction.

## Transition Logic
Wheel is a peak backbend. It requires significant wrist, shoulder, and hip flexor preparation (e.g., *Bridge Pose* or *Lunge*). Always exit by tucking the chin to the chest and lowering the upper back first.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For students with carpal tunnel, use blocks against the wall. For those with tight hip flexors, stay in *Bridge Pose*. Avoid entirely if the practitioner has high blood pressure, vertigo, or acute wrist/shoulder injuries.
