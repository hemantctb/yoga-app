# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Grounded Descent
The "vibe" is one of heavy, earthy stability. It is about returning to a primal posture of rest and elimination, moving the energy (Apana Vayu) downward.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Spine Long > Heels Down
The non-negotiable rule is a neutral, long spine. If the student rounds the back excessively to get the heels down, they must elevate the heels (blanket) or the hips (block). A rounded lower back under the weight of a squat creates unnecessary vertebral pressure.

## Transition Logic
Commonly enters from a wide-legged Mountain Pose (Tadasana) by hinging at the hips and knees. It is an excellent transition point into arm balances like Crow Pose (Bakasana) or stepping back into a Plank.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For students with knee injuries, limit the depth of the squat. For those with tight Achilles tendons, always provide heel support to prevent the weight from falling forward into the toes and straining the knee joint.
