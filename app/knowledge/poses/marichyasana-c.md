# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "One leg extended, the other bent with foot near hip."
    - "Twist toward the bent knee and bind behind your back."
    - "Keep the spine long and gaze over the back shoulder."
  foundation: 
    - "Root down through both sitting bones; sit on a blanket if necessary."
    - "Bent foot flat on the floor, about a fist-width from the hip."
  alignment: 
    - "Inhale to lengthen the spine, then exhale to initiate the twist from the lower abdomen."
    - "Use the bent knee as leverage for the twist; the elbow hooks outside the knee."
    - "Shoulders stay broad and relaxed, drawing away from the ears."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen, exhale to deepen the twist."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["force twist", "round back", "pain", "yank"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Twist hard."
      elevated: "Invite a spiraling rotation from the core, allowing the torso to wring out and detoxify with each exhalation."

# ASSISTS (Hands-On)
assists:
  - id: "marichyasana-c-bind-deepening"
    title: "Shoulder Opening & Bind"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand behind the student. Gently guide the binding arm further around, encouraging the shoulder to open and the hands to clasp."
    safety_check: "Avoid forcing the bind; ensure there's no pain in the shoulder or wrist."
  - id: "marichyasana-c-spinal-rotation"
    title: "Torso Revolve"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Place one hand on the sacrum for grounding and the other on the mid-back (scapula area) to encourage a deeper spinal rotation on the exhale."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student is not compressing their lower back; encourage length before depth."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Spinal Detoxification & Shoulder Mobility
Marichyasana C is a powerful seated twist that aims to detoxify the body through internal organ massage and improve spinal mobility, while challenging shoulder flexibility for the bind. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure spinal length before twisting, safe binding, and mindful progression into the twist.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length & Shoulder Safety > Twist Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a long, neutral spine throughout the twist and to avoid forcing the shoulder bind. If the AI detects rounding in the back, shoulder pain, or compression, it should suggest using a strap for the bind or reducing the depth of the twist, prioritizing joint health and spinal integrity.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory seated postures. It is a challenging pose that requires careful setup and mindful execution. Transition out by releasing the bind, slowly unwinding the torso, and returning to Dandasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, shoulder, or lower back injuries. Use a strap if the bind is not accessible. Sit on a blanket to help with hip alignment and spinal length. Avoid deep twists during pregnancy.
