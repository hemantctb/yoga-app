# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Balance on sitting bones, legs extended up and forward."
    - "Hold onto outer edges of feet or big toes."
    - "Draw chest towards legs, keeping spine long."
  foundation: 
    - "Establish a strong balance on your sitting bones, actively pressing them down."
    - "Keep your core deeply engaged to support the spine and maintain stability."
  alignment: 
    - "Lengthen through the crown of the head, drawing the navel toward the spine."
    - "Shoulders remain broad and relaxed, away from the ears."
    - "Micro-bend knees if hamstrings are too tight to maintain a straight spine."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen the spine, exhale to deepen the forward fold."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["fall", "round back", "lock knees", "slouch"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Pull your chest to your legs."
      elevated: "Invite the torso to fold deeply over the legs, allowing the energy of the spine to extend from the sitting bones through the crown."

    title: "Leg Extension Support"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand beside the student. Place hands on the calves or inner thighs and gently encourage further extension of the legs, especially on an exhale."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing directly on the knee joint; ensure the student's spine remains long."

    title: "Core Stability & Length"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Place a hand on the student's mid-back and gently encourage them to lengthen through the spine and engage the core, assisting with the forward fold."
    safety_check: "Be gentle and ensure the student maintains balance; avoid forcing the fold."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Ultimate Hamstring Length & Spinal Extension
Urdhva Mukha Paschimottanasana is about achieving maximum length in the hamstrings and spine while balancing on the sitting bones. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage core engagement, spinal length, and a deep, sustained forward fold without compromising balance or joint safety.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length & Sitting Bone Balance > Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a long, straight spine, balancing precisely on the sitting bones. If the AI detects rounding in the back, rolling onto the tailbone, or an inability to maintain balance, it should suggest bending the knees, using a strap, or practicing preparatory poses to build flexibility and strength.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Ubhaya Padangustasana, building upon the same balancing and hamstring flexibility. It is often followed by a transition to Setu Bandhasana (Bridge Pose).

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose requiring extreme hamstring flexibility and strong core strength. Not suitable for individuals with acute hamstring, hip, or lower back injuries. Using a strap is highly recommended for those with tight hamstrings. Avoid if there are any acute wrist or shoulder issues due to the hand grip.
