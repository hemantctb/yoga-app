# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Backbend & Front Body Opening
Laghu Vajrasana aims for a profound opening across the entire front of the body, particularly the quadriceps, hip flexors, and chest, combined with a deep spinal backbend. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee and neck safety, mindful progression into the backbend, and even distribution of the spinal curve.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Neck Safety > Depth of Backbend
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knees and cervical spine. If the AI detects knee pain, neck compression, or pinching in the lower back, it should prompt the student to back off, use modifications (e.g., Camel Pose, support under head), or practice preparatory stretches.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory kneeling backbends like Camel Pose or Hero's Pose. It is often followed by Child's Pose as a counter-stretch.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, ankle, hip, neck, or back injuries. Always use proper knee cushioning (blanket) and listen to the body for any signs of strain.
