## The Semantic Goal: Finding the Midline
Warrior III is about the center of gravity. The AI should prioritize cues that keep the body integrated around the spine, preventing the hips from "opening" to the side.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Squaring the Pelvis
[Image of the pelvic alignment in Warrior III showing neutral hips versus tilted hips]
Students often lift the hip of the floating leg. The AI must check for cues like "Internal rotation of the back thigh" or "Toes point down."

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **Neck Alignment:** Ensure the gaze is down and slightly forward to keep the back of the neck long.
- **Lower Back Protection:** If the spine rounds, suggest lowering the back leg or using blocks.
