# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Ultimate Arm Balance & Flexibility Integration
Tittibhasana C is a pinnacle arm balance that demonstrates extreme hamstring and inner thigh flexibility combined with powerful upper body and core strength, all while maintaining a complex leg integration. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure wrist and hip safety, emphasize maximum arm and core engagement, and encourage a precise, controlled leg position.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Strong Base & Hamstring Length > Leg Position
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a strong, stable base with the hands and to have exceptional hamstring and inner thigh flexibility to achieve the leg cross without rounding the spine or straining the wrists. If the AI detects instability, wrist strain, or excessive spinal rounding, it should prompt the student to lower down, use blocks for hand support, or work on preparatory poses.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Tittibhasana B. It is often a final expression before returning to a grounded pose or Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an extremely advanced arm balance and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with any wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, or hamstring injuries. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely and should only be attempted under expert guidance. Listen to the body, and do not force entry.
