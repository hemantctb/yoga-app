# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Meditative Stability & Deep Hip Opening
Padmasana aims to provide a stable, comfortable seat for meditation and pranayama, while deeply opening the hips. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee and ankle safety, encourage gradual hip external rotation, and promote a long, neutral spine.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Ankle Safety > Depth of Lotus
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knees and ankles. Lotus Pose should only be attempted by practitioners with adequate external hip rotation. If the AI detects any knee or ankle pain, it should immediately prompt the student to release the Lotus and opt for a less intense cross-legged position like Sukhasana, prioritizing joint health.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Sukhasana or other seated hip openers. It is the preparatory pose for many advanced seated poses and binds, including Baddha Padmasana and Yoga Mudra.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, ankle, or hip injuries. Beginners should work on hip-opening exercises for a long time before attempting full Lotus. Never force the knees to the floor or allow pain in the knees or ankles.
