  - prop: "block"
    purpose: "Hand Support"
    instruction: "Place blocks under your hands if reaching the floor causes rounding in the spine; prioritize a long spine over depth."

cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Stand tall, fold forward from the hips."
    - "Grab your big toes with your first two fingers and thumb."
    - "Lengthen your spine on the inhale, deepen the fold on the exhale."
  foundation: 
    - "Feet hip-width apart, parallel."
    - "Press through all four corners of your feet."
  alignment: 
    - "Keep your knees micro-bent if hamstrings are tight."
    - "Elbows wide, drawing shoulders away from ears."
    - "Lift your sit bones towards the sky."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen, exhale to fold deeper."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING

  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Pull your head to your knees."
      elevated: "Draw the crown of your head toward the earth, allowing gravity to gently decompress your spine."

assists:
  - id: "big-toe-pose-sacrum-traction"
    title: "Spinal Lengthening"
    type: "traction"
    instruction: "Place a hand on the sacrum and gently encourage it to lift and tilt forward, creating space in the lower back."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student's knees have a micro-bend; do not force the stretch."
  - id: "big-toe-pose-hamstring-release"
    title: "Hamstring Softening"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Gently press down on the upper thighs (near the hip crease) on the exhale to encourage a deeper fold."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing on the knee joint; communicate with the student about intensity."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Spinal Release & Hamstring Opening
This pose is about lengthening the entire back line of the body. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize a long spine and a gentle, sustainable stretch in the hamstrings, rather than forcing the head to the knees.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip Hinging over Lumbar Rounding
The non-negotiable rule is that the fold must originate from the hips, not the lower back. If the AI detects excessive lumbar rounding, it should prompt the student to micro-bend their knees or use props (blocks under hands) to maintain a flat back.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Mountain Pose or other standing postures. Often a preparatory pose for deeper forward folds. Transition out by releasing the grip, placing hands on hips, and slowly rolling up to standing.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For very tight hamstrings, deeply bend the knees to allow the torso to rest on the thighs. For lower back pain, keep the spine long and parallel to the floor, even if it means less depth in the fold.
