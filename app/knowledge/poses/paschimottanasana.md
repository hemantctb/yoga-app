# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Quiet Surrender
The goal is to move inward. The AI should prioritize detecting 'struggle' in the neck and jaw, redirecting the student toward a prop if they are over-exerting.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Spine straight > Legs straight
The non-negotiable rule is the avoidance of lumbar rounding. If the AI detects the lower back is bowing outward, it must cue the student to bend their knees or sit on a blanket.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows active seated work or serves as a cooling down posture. Transition out should be slow, rolling up one vertebra at a time.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Contraindicated for students with acute disc herniations or sciatica; these students should keep the spine completely vertical or avoid the pose. For pregnancy, use a wide-legged variation to make space for the belly.
