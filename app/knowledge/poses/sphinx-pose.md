# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Grounded Radiance
The "soul" of Sphinx is regal stability. Unlike more active backbends, Sphinx is about finding a sustainable lift that feels like an offering of the heart, rooted in a heavy, stable lower body.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Axial Extension over Compression
The non-negotiable rule is: **Length > Height**. The student must avoid "dumping" into the lower back. If the lumbar spine feels compressed, the elbows should be moved slightly forward of the shoulders to reduce the angle of extension.

## Transition Logic
Sphinx is a primary transitional bridge from prone belly-resting into more intense backbends like *Upward-Facing Dog*. It often leads into *Child's Pose* as a counter-stretch or *Downward-Dog* for a full-body reset.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For pregnancy, Sphinx should be practiced with a bolster under the thighs and chest to avoid direct pressure on the belly. For those with acute lower back pain, keeping the gaze down and the glutes soft can prevent further irritation of the SI joint.
