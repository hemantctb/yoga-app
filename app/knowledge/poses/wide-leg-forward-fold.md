# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Stand with wide legs, feet parallel."
    - "Hinge forward from your hips, keeping your spine long."
    - "Release the crown of your head towards the floor."
  foundation: 
    - "Press through the outer edges of your feet, lifting the inner arches."
    - "Engage your quadriceps to lift your kneecaps."
  alignment: 
    - "Keep your hips stacked over your ankles."
    - "Draw your shoulders away from your ears."
    - "Hands can be on the floor, blocks, or holding your ankles/big toes."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen your spine, exhale to deepen the fold."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["round back", "lock knees", "force down"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Put your head on the floor."
      elevated: "Allow the crown of the head to gravitate toward the earth, facilitating a complete release of the neck and spine."

# ASSISTS (Hands-On)
assists:
  - id: "wide-leg-forward-fold-hips-traction"
    title: "Pelvic Decompression"
    type: "traction"
    instruction: "Stand behind the student. Place hands on the outer hips and gently pull them upward and back, encouraging a deeper hinge from the hips."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student's knees have a micro-bend; do not force the stretch if they have tight hamstrings."
  - id: "wide-leg-forward-fold-spinal-release"
    title: "Spinal Lengthening"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Place one hand on the sacrum and the other on the upper back. On the exhale, gently encourage length through the spine, maintaining its natural curve."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing on the neck; communicate about comfort and intensity."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Spinal Decompression & Inner Thigh Release
This pose aims to lengthen the spine and open the inner thighs. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage a flat back and a deep, sensation-based stretch rather than achieving a specific depth.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip Hinging over Lumbar Rounding
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the lower back by folding from the hips. If the AI detects rounding in the lumbar spine, it should suggest bending the knees, placing hands on blocks, or reducing the stance width.

## Transition Logic
Commonly entered from a wide-legged standing position. Often a preparatory pose for inversions like headstand or other seated forward folds. Transition out by lifting with a flat back, hands on hips, or walking hands forward.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For very tight hamstrings or lower back issues, keep a significant bend in the knees and use blocks for hands. Always maintain active quadriceps to protect the knee joints.
