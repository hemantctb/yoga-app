# PROPS & GUIDANCE
props: ["strap", "blanket"]
prop_guidance:
  - prop: "strap"
    purpose: "Hamstring Release"
    instruction: "Use a strap looped around the sole of your lifted foot if you cannot comfortably hold your foot with straight arms and a long spine."
  - prop: "blanket"
    purpose: "Pelvic Elevation"
    instruction: "Sit on a folded blanket to elevate the hips, making it easier to maintain a long spine and lift the leg."

# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Sit with one leg bent back, the other extended forward."
    - "Lift the extended leg, holding onto the foot (or strap)."
    - "Keep your spine long and chest open."
  foundation: 
    - "Ensure both sitting bones are firmly grounded; sit on a blanket if needed."
    - "Keep the bent knee and foot tucked closely to the hip, similar to Virasana."
  alignment: 
    - "Lengthen through the crown of the head, drawing the lifted leg closer to the torso."
    - "Keep the lifted leg straight, actively engaging the quadriceps."
    - "Shoulders remain relaxed and drawn down the back."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen the spine, exhale to draw the leg closer."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["round back", "force leg", "pain", "lock knee"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Pull your leg to your face."
      elevated: "Invite the lifted leg to ascend toward the torso, allowing the hamstring to unravel with mindful intention and breath."

# ASSISTS (Hands-On)
assists:
  - id: "heron-pose-hamstring-deepening"
    title: "Hamstring Release"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand beside the student. Place one hand on the lifted ankle and the other on the thigh, gently encouraging the leg closer to the torso on an exhale."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing directly on the knee joint; communicate about intensity and any sharp pain."
  - id: "heron-pose-spinal-lengthening"
    title: "Axial Extension"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Place one hand on the sacrum and the other on the upper back, encouraging length through the spine, helping the student sit tall."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student is not rounding the lower back; emphasize length over pulling."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Hamstring Stretch & Core Engagement
Krounchasana aims for an intense hamstring stretch while maintaining a long, upright spine and engaging the core. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage spinal length, knee safety (especially of the bent leg), and a gradual, controlled approach to lifting and extending the leg.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length & Knee Safety > Leg Height
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a long, neutral spine, balancing on the sitting bones. If the AI detects rounding in the back or discomfort in the bent knee, it should suggest using a strap for the lifted leg, sitting on a blanket, or reducing the height of the lifted leg.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Janu Sirsasana or other seated hamstring stretches. It often precedes other seated forward bends or twists. Always practice on both sides for equal duration.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute knee injuries (especially the bent knee). If there is any knee pain, modify by placing a blanket under the bent knee or practicing a simpler hamstring stretch. Use a strap for the lifted leg if hamstrings are very tight.
