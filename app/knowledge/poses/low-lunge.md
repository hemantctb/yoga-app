# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Expansive Rooting
The soul of Low Lunge is the duality of the lower body sinking into the earth while the upper body reaches for the heavens. The vibe is one of 'triumphant surrender.'



## The Biomechanical North Star: Front Knee Over Ankle
The non-negotiable is the safety of the front knee joint. If the knee shears forward past the ankle, it places undue stress on the patella. The AI must prioritize 'Knee-Ankle Stacking' before any hip sinking.

## Transition Logic
Commonly used in Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar). It serves as a bridge between the strength of Plank/Downward Dog and the flexibility required for seated poses or deeper backbends.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For students with sensitive knees, the 'blanket' prop is mandatory. If the backbend causes pinching in the lower back, cue the student to keep their hands on their front thigh rather than reaching up.
