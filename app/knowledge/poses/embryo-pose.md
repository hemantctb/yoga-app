# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Ultimate Spinal Decompression & Internal Organ Massage
Pindasana aims for an extremely deep spinal decompression and internal organ massage through a compressed, inverted forward fold. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck and knee safety, a stable foundation in Shoulderstand, and a mindful, non-forced approach to the deep compression.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Neck & Knee Safety > Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the cervical spine and the knees in Lotus. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with an already established and comfortable Urdhva Padmasana. If the AI detects any neck pain, knee strain, or inability to breathe freely, it should immediately prompt the student to release the pose.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Urdhva Padmasana. It is often followed by Matsyasana (Fish Pose) as a counter-stretch.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced inversion and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute neck, shoulder, knee, or hip injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during pregnancy. Always use blankets under the shoulders to protect the neck. Never turn the head in this pose.
