# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Full Body Arm Balance & Internal Organ Toning
Mayurasana aims for a challenging horizontal arm balance that strengthens the entire upper body and core, while also massaging and toning the abdominal organs. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize strong arm and core engagement, careful weight distribution, and a gradual, controlled lift.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Elbow Placement & Core Engagement > Lift Height
The non-negotiable rule is the precise placement of the elbows into the abdomen and strong core engagement to protect the lower back and support the horizontal lift. If the AI detects instability, wrist strain, or excessive arching in the lower back, it should prompt the student to lower down, adjust elbow placement, or work on preparatory poses.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory poses like Balasana (Child's Pose) or Dandasana, focusing on wrist and core strength.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced arm balance and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with any wrist, elbow, shoulder, or abdominal injuries, or during menstruation/pregnancy. It requires significant preparation and strength.
