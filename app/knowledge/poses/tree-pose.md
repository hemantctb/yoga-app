  - id: "tree-pose-arms-traction"
    title: "Vertical Traction"
    type: "traction"
    instruction: "Gently grasp the student's wrists when arms are raised and provide a light upward lift to encourage spinal decompression."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Rooted Expansion
Tree pose is the study of stillness within movement. The vibe is grounding yet light. The AI should prioritize detecting "quietness" in the standing foot and a steady, unflickering gaze.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip Stability > Leg Height
The non-negotiable is the avoidance of "hiking" the hip of the bent leg. When the hip lifts to accommodate a high foot placement, the spine tilts and the standing glute medius disengages. The AI must prioritize "Level Pelvis" over "Foot in Groin."

## Transition Logic
Transitioning from Tadasana (Mountain Pose) is the standard entrance. It often precedes more complex balances or acts as a "reset" between side-switching standing sequences.

## Inclusivity & Safety
**Critical Warning:** Never place the foot directly on the side of the knee. This creates lateral pressure on the joint. For students with vertigo or inner ear issues, the gaze (Drishti) should remain on the floor 4 feet in front of them rather than at the nose-tip.
