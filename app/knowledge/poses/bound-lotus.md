# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Hip & Shoulder Opening with Internal Focus
Baddha Padmasana aims for a profound opening in the hips and shoulders while promoting deep introspection and internal organ stimulation. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee and hip safety in Lotus, safe shoulder binding, and a long, uncompressed spine.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Hip Safety > Bind Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knees and hips in Lotus Pose. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with an already established and comfortable Lotus. If the AI detects any knee pain, hip strain, or forced binding, it should prompt the student to release the Lotus or use a strap for the bind, prioritizing joint health.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Padmasana. It often transitions into Yoga Mudra or other seated variations.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose requiring extreme hip and shoulder flexibility. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with any knee, hip, ankle, or shoulder injuries. If Lotus is uncomfortable, this pose is not appropriate. Use a strap if the bind is not accessible.
