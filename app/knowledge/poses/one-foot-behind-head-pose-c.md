# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Peak Flexibility & Arm Balance Mastery
Ekapada Sirsasana C is a pinnacle pose integrating extreme hip flexibility with advanced arm balance skills, demanding full body control and intense mental focus. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure hip, knee, and neck safety, emphasize maximum arm and core engagement, and encourage a precise, controlled vertical extension of the free leg.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Foot Behind Head & Powerful Lift > Vertical Alignment
The non-negotiable rule is to have the foot securely and comfortably behind the head, and to use powerful arm and core strength for a controlled lift. If the AI detects instability, strain in the neck/hips/knees, or weak arm/core engagement, it should prompt the student to lower down and reassess, or work on preparatory poses.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Ekapada Sirsasana B. It is a preparatory pose for Dwipada Sirsasana and Yoga Nidrasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an extremely advanced pose and is not suitable for beginners or individuals with any hip, knee, ankle, neck, wrist, elbow, or shoulder injuries. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely and should only be attempted under expert guidance. Listen to the body, and do not force entry.
