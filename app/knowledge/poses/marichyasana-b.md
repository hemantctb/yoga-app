# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Complex Hip & Spinal Integration
Marichyasana B integrates a deep hip opener (half lotus), a forward fold, and a bind, demanding significant flexibility and body awareness. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee and spinal safety, mindful progression into the bind, and a long, uncompressed spine throughout the fold.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Spinal Integrity > Depth of Bind/Fold
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee of the lotus leg and avoid rounding the lower back. If the AI detects knee pain, excessive lumbar rounding, or forced binding, it should prompt the student to release the lotus, use a strap, or reduce the depth of the fold, prioritizing joint health over pose completion.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Marichyasana A or other hip-opening preparations. It is a challenging pose that requires careful setup and mindful execution. Transition out by releasing the bind, slowly lifting the torso, and gently releasing the lotus leg.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for individuals with knee, ankle, hip, or shoulder injuries. If there is any pain, modifications (such as avoiding the lotus or the bind) are essential.
