# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Rooted Expansion & Focused Equilibrium
This pose is about balancing grounded stability with expansive lengthening. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize a strong foundation in the standing leg and core, allowing for a steady, controlled extension of the lifted leg.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip Leveling > Leg Height
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain level hips throughout the pose. If the AI detects the hip of the lifted leg rising significantly, it should suggest lowering the leg or bending the knee more, prioritizing pelvic stability over the height of the leg.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Mountain Pose or simpler standing balances. It often leads into other balancing poses or a return to standing. Ensure a smooth transition in and out to maintain stability.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For individuals with tight hamstrings, using a strap is essential. For balance challenges, practicing near a wall or with a hand on a chair can provide support. Emphasize a micro-bend in the standing knee to prevent hyperextension.
