# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Arm Balance from Lotus & Core Strength
Tolasana aims to build immense upper body and core strength, balanced with deep hip flexibility, from the foundation of Lotus Pose. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize strong arm engagement, deep core activation, and a mindful, controlled lift.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Lotus & Arm Strength > Height
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a stable and pain-free Lotus Pose and to engage the arms and core fully before attempting the lift. If the AI detects knee pain, wrist strain, or a lack of core engagement, it should prompt the student to use blocks or return to preparatory poses.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Padmasana or Bound Lotus. It is a powerful pose that requires strength and control. Often followed by Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced arm balance requiring extreme hip flexibility and strong upper body/core. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with any knee, hip, wrist, elbow, or shoulder injuries. Prioritize joint safety over achieving the full expression.
