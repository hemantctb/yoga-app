# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Enhanced Headstand Balance & Shoulder Strength
Baddha Hasta Sirsasana A aims to build greater shoulder and core strength by integrating the arm bind into the headstand. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck and shoulder safety, emphasize strong forearm and core engagement, and encourage a controlled, gradual lift.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Forearm Base & Core Engagement > Kicking Up
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a strong, stable base with the interlaced hands and to use core and shoulder strength for lifting, rather than kicking up. If the AI detects instability, neck strain, or improper hand/head placement, it should immediately prompt the student to lower down and reassess, or practice against a wall.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows regular Headstand (Sirsasana) and preparatory arm/shoulder strengthening poses. It is a preparatory pose for Baddha Hasta Sirsasana B.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced inversion and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute neck, shoulder, or spinal injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during menstruation/pregnancy. Always learn from a qualified teacher and use a wall for safety.
