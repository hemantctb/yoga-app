    instruction: "Place a block under the bottom hand on the inside or outside of the front foot to maintain spinal length during the twist."
  - prop: "wall"
    purpose: "Heel Grounding"
    instruction: "Press the outer edge of the back foot against a wall to ensure the foundation remains stable as the torso rotates."

# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Square your hips toward the front of the mat."
    - "Extend your spine forward before initiating the rotation."
    - "Reach the top hand toward the sky while grounding through both heels."
  foundation: 
    - "Scissor your inner thighs toward each other to stabilize the pelvis."
    - "Root the back heel at a 45-degree angle, sealing the outer edge of the foot."
  alignment: 
    - "Draw the front hip crease back and the back hip forward to keep the sacrum level."
    - "Stack the top shoulder directly over the bottom shoulder."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen the crown away from the tailbone; exhale to deepen the twist from the navel."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Grounded Spiraling
Revolved Triangle is about finding the "still point" in a storm of opposing forces. It represents the ability to remain rooted in your foundation (Muladhara) while expanding your perspective (Anahata).



## The Biomechanical North Star: Spine Length > Rotation
The non-negotiable rule is that the spine must be fully extended before twisting. Twisting a rounded (flexed) spine creates dangerous pressure on the intervertebral discs. If the student cannot keep their back flat, they must use a block to elevate the torso.

## Transition Logic
Commonly enters from *Pyramid Pose* or *Extended Triangle*. It is a high-stability pose that requires a shorter stance than Warrior II. Exit by unwinding the torso back to center before rising or stepping forward.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For students with balance issues, suggest a wider stance (feet like 'train tracks' rather than a 'tightrope').  For neck sensitivity, the gaze (Drishti) should remain at the side wall or toward the floor rather than looking up at the thumb.
