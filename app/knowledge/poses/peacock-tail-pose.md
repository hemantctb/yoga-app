# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Inverted Strength, Balance & Focus
Pincha Mayurasana aims to build formidable upper body and core strength, while challenging balance and cultivating intense mental focus in an inverted position. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure shoulder and neck safety, strong forearm and core engagement, and a controlled, gradual lift.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Forearm Base & Core Engagement > Kicking Up
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a strong, stable base with the forearms and to use core strength for lifting, rather than kicking up. If the AI detects instability, shoulder strain, or improper forearm/head placement, it should immediately prompt the student to lower down and reassess, or practice against a wall.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory poses like Dolphin Pose or Handstand preparations. It is often followed by Child's Pose as a counter-pose and then Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced inversion and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute neck, shoulder, or spinal injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during menstruation/pregnancy. Always learn from a qualified teacher and use a wall for safety.
