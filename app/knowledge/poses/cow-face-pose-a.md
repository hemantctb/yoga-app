  - prop: "strap"
    purpose: "Shoulder Bind Assistance"
    instruction: "Use a strap to bridge the gap between your hands if you cannot comfortably clasp them behind your back."
  - prop: "blanket"
    purpose: "Pelvic Elevation"
    instruction: "Sit on a folded blanket to elevate the hips, making it easier to stack the knees and maintain a long spine."
  - prop: "block"
    purpose: "Knee Support"
    instruction: "Place a block or small cushion between the knees if there's discomfort or a large gap when stacking."

# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Stack knees one over the other, feet by hips."
    - "Reach one arm up, other down, clasp hands behind back."
    - "Sit tall, breathe into hips and shoulders."
  foundation: 
    - "Ensure both sitting bones are equally grounded, adjusting hips or using a blanket if needed."
    - "Keep the feet active and close to the hips."
  alignment: 
    - "Lengthen through the crown of the head, stacking the spine directly over the pelvis."
    - "Draw the shoulder blades down the back, creating space in the neck."
    - "Keep the knees aligned as much as possible, or use a prop between them."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen the spine, exhale to deepen the hip and shoulder release."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["force knees", "pain", "round back", "shrug shoulders"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Stack your knees."
      elevated: "Invite the knees to align vertically, allowing for a profound external rotation and release in the hip joints."

    title: "Pelvic Engagement"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand behind the student. Place hands on the outer hips and gently encourage the top knee to settle down, aligning the pelvis."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing directly on the knee joint; communicate about intensity and any sharp pain."

    title: "Shoulder Release"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand beside the student. Gently guide the hands closer for the bind, or offer a strap if hands don't meet, encouraging external and internal rotation."
    safety_check: "Avoid any forceful manipulation; ensure no pain in the shoulder or elbow."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Hip & Shoulder Opening with Spinal Length
Gomukhasana A aims to deeply open the hips and shoulders simultaneously, while maintaining a long, neutral spine. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee and shoulder safety, mindful progression into the binds, and even grounding through the sitting bones.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Hip Safety > Depth of Stack/Bind
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee joints. If the AI detects knee pain, excessive hip tilting, or forced shoulder binding, it should prompt the student to use props (blanket, block, strap) or reduce the intensity of the hip stack.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Sukhasana or other seated preparations. It is often followed by a forward fold (Gomukhasana B) or other seated variations. Always practice on both sides for equal duration.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, hip, or shoulder injuries. Use props generously to support the hips and knees. Never force the knees to stack if there is pain.
