# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Inverted Hip Opening & Advanced Balance
Baddha Hasta Sirsasana B aims for a deep inverted hip opening (straddle split) while maintaining balance in headstand with bound hands. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck and shoulder safety, emphasize strong forearm and core engagement, and encourage a controlled, gradual spreading of the legs.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Base & Core Engagement > Leg Spread Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a strong, stable base with the forearms and to use core and shoulder strength for stability. If the AI detects instability, neck strain, or improper hand/head placement, it should immediately prompt the student to lower down and reassess, or practice against a wall. The depth of the leg spread is secondary to safety.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Baddha Hasta Sirsasana A. It is a preparatory pose for Baddha Hasta Sirsasana C.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced inversion and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute neck, shoulder, or spinal injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during menstruation/pregnancy. Always learn from a qualified teacher and use a wall for safety.
