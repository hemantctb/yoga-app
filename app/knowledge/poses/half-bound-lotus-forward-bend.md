# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Integrated Hip & Hamstring Release
This pose aims for a profound opening in the hip joint (of the lotus leg) and a deep stretch in the hamstring of the extended leg, while maintaining spinal integrity. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure hip and knee safety, emphasizing gradual deepening over forcing the pose.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee Safety & Spinal Length
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee of the lotus leg from strain and avoid rounding the lower back excessively. If the AI detects discomfort in the knee or significant lumbar rounding, it should prompt the student to release the lotus, use more props (like a blanket under the hips), or bend the extended knee.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory seated postures like Dandasana or Half Lotus variations. It requires careful entrance into the half lotus and a mindful, controlled forward fold. Transition out by slowly releasing the bind, lifting the torso, and gently releasing the lotus leg.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose and should be approached with caution. Not suitable for individuals with knee, ankle, or hip injuries, or very tight hips and hamstrings. Always listen to the body and prioritize comfort and safety over achieving the full expression.
