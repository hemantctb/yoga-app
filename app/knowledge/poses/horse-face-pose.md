# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Extreme Hip & Ankle Flexibility with Balance
Vatayanasana aims for an intricate combination of deep hip and ankle flexibility with seated balance. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee and ankle safety, gradual and mindful entry, and maintaining spinal length and core engagement.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Ankle Safety > Achieving Pose
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee and ankle joints from strain. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with highly developed, pain-free hip and ankle flexibility. If the AI detects any pain in the knees, ankles, or hips, it should immediately prompt the student to release the pose.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory hip and ankle openers, including Half Lotus variations.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose and is not suitable for beginners or individuals with any hip, knee, or ankle injuries. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely. Listen to the body, and do not force entry.
