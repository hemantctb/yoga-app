# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Heart Opening & Full Body Backbend
Dhanurasana aims for a deep, invigorating backbend that opens the entire front of the body and strengthens the back. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage active kicking, chest opening, and proper knee alignment to protect the lower back.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Active Legs & Open Chest > Deep Arch
The non-negotiable rule is to use the strength of the legs (kicking back) to lift the torso, rather than forcing the lower back into a deep arch. If the AI detects pinching in the lower back or knees splaying too wide, it should prompt the student to reduce the intensity, adjust knee width, or use a blanket under the pelvis.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows prone backbends like Locust Pose or Cobra Pose. It is often followed by Child's Pose as a counter-stretch or a gentle reclined twist.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute back or neck injuries, high blood pressure, or abdominal issues. For beginners, a gentle modification like Half Bow Pose (Ardha Dhanurasana) can be practiced. Always listen to the body and avoid any sharp pain.
