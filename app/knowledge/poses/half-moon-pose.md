cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Stack the top hip directly over the bottom hip."
    - "Extend the top arm toward the sky, opening the chest."
    - "Flex the floating foot strongly as if pressing against a wall."

    - "Root into the four corners of the standing foot."
    - "Position the standing hand directly under the shoulder (or on a block)."
  alignment: 
    - "Keep the standing knee tracking over the second toe."
    - "Engage the floating leg's quadriceps to maintain a straight line from crown to heel."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to expand the limbs away from the center; exhale to stabilize the core."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["kick", "dangle", "collapse"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Lift your back leg."
      elevated: "Extend your lifted leg strongly from your heel to engage the back of your body."

assists:
  - id: "half-moon-pose-hips-alignment"
    title: "Hip Stacking Support"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Stand behind the student. Place one hand on the standing hip and the other on the lifted hip, guiding the pelvis into a vertical plane."
    safety_check: "Avoid pulling the lifted hip back too far if the standing knee is unstable."
  - id: "half-moon-pose-torso-deepening"
    title: "Lateral Expansion"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Gently place a hand on the student's top shoulder to encourage the chest to rotate open toward the side wall."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student has a solid foundation before adding rotational pressure."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Expansion
The "soul" of this pose is radiant expansion. The practitioner should feel as though they are growing outward from the navel point, occupying space in 360 degrees.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Lateral Plane Integrity
The non-negotiable rule is that the body must remain in a single lateral plane (as if between two panes of glass). Spine length and hip stacking take precedence over the height of the lifted leg.

## Transition Logic
Commonly entered from *Extended Triangle* by bending the front knee and stepping the hand forward. It transitions beautifully into *Warrior 3* via a 90-degree internal rotation of the lifted hip.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For neck issues, keep the drishti toward the floor. If the standing hamstring is tight, always use a block to prevent the torso from collapsing downward, which compromises the SI joint.
