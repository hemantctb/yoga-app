## The Semantic Goal: Stable Fire
Balance between the heavy, rooting energy of the lower body and the light, reaching energy of the upper body.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Posterior Weight Shift
[Image of human skeleton in chair pose showing center of gravity over heels]
The weight must be in the heels to protect the patella. If the teacher doesn't mention "heels" or "seeing the toes," flag it.

## Transition Logic
- **Surya Namaskar B:** Emphasize the **Inhale** to sweep arms up while simultaneously sitting back.

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **Jaw-Release:** Users often clench their jaw. AI should suggest: "Soften the space between your eyebrows."
- **Pelvic Position:** Avoid "Tuck your tailbone." Use "Neutralize the pelvis" to maintain the natural lumbar curve.
