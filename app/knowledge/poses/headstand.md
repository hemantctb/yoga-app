# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Full Body Integration & Inverted Balance
Sirsasana aims for complete body integration, balance, and mental clarity through inversion. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck and shoulder safety, core engagement, and a controlled entry and exit from the pose.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Tripod Base & Core Engagement > Kicking Up
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a strong, stable base with the forearms and head, and to use core strength for lifting, rather than kicking up. If the AI detects instability, neck strain, or improper hand/head placement, it should immediately prompt the student to lower down and reassess.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory poses like Downward-Dog or Dolphin Pose. It is often followed by Child's Pose as a counter-pose and then Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced inversion and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute neck, shoulder, or spinal injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during menstruation/pregnancy. Always learn from a qualified teacher.
