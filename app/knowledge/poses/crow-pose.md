# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Arm Balance & Core Strength Foundation
Bakasana serves as a fundamental arm balance, building crucial upper body and core strength, while also challenging fear and building concentration. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize a strong foundation in the hands, deep core engagement, and a mindful forward weight shift.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Strong Base & Core Engagement > Kicking Up
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a strong, stable base with the hands and to use core strength for lifting, rather than kicking up. If the AI detects instability, wrist strain, or improper arm/knee placement, it should immediately prompt the student to lower down and reassess. A block under the head can alleviate fear of falling.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows deep squats (Malasana) or preparatory core work. It often transitions into Chaturanga Dandasana or other arm balances.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with wrist, elbow, or shoulder injuries. Beginners should work on core strength and wrist preparation exercises before attempting this pose. Use props like a block under the forehead to build confidence.
