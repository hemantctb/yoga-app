# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Structural Integrity
The essence of Pyramid Pose is finding "sthirasukham" (steadiness and ease) by creating a stable, tripod-like architectural base that supports the surrender of the upper body.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Pelvic Neutrality
The priority is a level and squared sacrum rather than the depth of the fold. Spine length and hip alignment must take precedence over the torso reaching the leg.

## Transition Logic
Step back from Mountain Pose or straighten the front leg from Warrior 1, shortening the stance by 6-12 inches. Exit by shifting weight forward into Warrior 3 or stepping the back foot forward into Standing Forward Bend.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For tight hamstrings, use blocks to keep the torso parallel to the floor. Always cue a micro-bend in the front knee to prevent hyperextension and protect the hamstring attachment at the ischial tuberosity.
