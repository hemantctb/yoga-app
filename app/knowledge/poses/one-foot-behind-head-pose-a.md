# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Extreme Hip Opening & Body Integration
Ekapada Sirsasana A is an advanced pose aiming for extreme external hip rotation and a unique integration of the body. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure hip and knee safety, gradual and mindful entry, and maintaining spinal length throughout the pose.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip & Knee Safety > Achieving Pose
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee and hip joints from strain. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with highly developed hip flexibility. If the AI detects any pain in the knee, hip, or neck, it should immediately prompt the student to release the pose and work on preparatory hip openers.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows deep seated forward folds and hip openers. It is a preparatory pose for Dwipada Sirsasana and Yoga Nidrasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an extremely advanced pose and is not suitable for beginners or individuals with any hip, knee, ankle, or neck injuries. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely. Listen to the body, and do not force entry.
