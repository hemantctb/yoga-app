# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Profound Front Body Release & Backbend Integration
Supta Urdhvapada Vajrasana A aims for an extremely deep, full-body backbend that intensely stretches the quadriceps, hip flexors, and abdomen, while opening the chest and stimulating energy. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee, ankle, and neck safety, mindful progression into the backbend, and proper spinal alignment.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Ankle Safety > Depth of Backbend
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee and ankle joints from strain. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with highly developed flexibility. If the AI detects knee or ankle pain, or pinching in the lower back or neck, it should prompt the student to back off, use modifications (e.g., bolster support), or practice preparatory stretches.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Supta Vajrasana. It is often followed by Supta Urdhvapada Vajrasana B.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, ankle, hip, neck, or back injuries. Always use proper knee and head cushioning (blanket) and listen to the body for any signs of strain.
