# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Ultimate Spinal & Hip Detoxification
Marichyasana D is a peak pose for spinal twisting, hip opening, and shoulder flexibility, aiming for deep internal organ massage and detoxification. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee, hip, and spinal safety, emphasizing mindful progression into the complex bind and twist.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Spinal Integrity > Depth of Bind/Twist
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee of the lotus leg and avoid rounding or compressing the lower back. If the AI detects knee pain, excessive lumbar rounding, or forced binding, it should prompt the student to release the lotus, use a strap, or reduce the depth of the twist, prioritizing joint health and spinal integrity.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Marichyasana C, building upon previous preparations. It is a highly challenging pose that requires significant body awareness and control. Transition out by releasing the bind, slowly unwinding the torso, and gently releasing the lotus leg.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for individuals with knee, ankle, hip, or shoulder injuries, or any acute spinal conditions. If there is any pain, modifications (such as avoiding the lotus or the bind) are essential. Avoid during pregnancy.
