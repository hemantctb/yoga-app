## The Semantic Goal: Radical Openness

Upward Dog is a heart-opener. The AI should look for cues that move the chest **forward** between the gates of the arms, rather than just arching back.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Active Legs
If the thighs are on the floor, it's Cobra, not Upward Dog. AI must prioritize cues about "pressing the tops of the feet" and "lifting the kneecaps" to protect the lumbar spine.

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **Shoulder Dumping:** If the neck disappears, the student is "dumping" into the joints. AI correction: "Press the earth away to find length in the neck."
- **Lower Back Sensitivity:** Suggest staying in Cobra (Bhujangasana) if the student feels a "pinch" in the lower back.
