# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Grounded Joy
The vibe is relaxation through surrender. The AI should look for 'tension markers' like hunched shoulders, a lifted tailbone, or a tensed jaw, and cue for a heavier, more anchored back body.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Tailbone Grounded > Knees Down
The non-negotiable is the spinal integrity. If the tailbone lifts high off the floor to grab the feet, the stretch is lost to lumbar rounding. The AI must prioritize 'Sacrum on Mat' above 'Holding the Feet.'

## Transition Logic
Typically positioned at the end of a sequence. It serves as a counter-stretch to backbends or as a final release before Savasana. Transition out by hugging knees to chest for a neutral reset.

## Inclusivity & Safety
If the student has a knee injury, cue them to hold the back of the thighs (hamstrings) rather than the feet to reduce the angle of flexion. During pregnancy, keep the knees wide to accommodate the belly and avoid long holds if lying flat on the back causes dizziness.
