# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Full Front Body Release & Backbend
Supta Vajrasana aims for a deep, full-body backbend that intensely stretches the quadriceps, hip flexors, and abdomen, while opening the chest and calming the nervous system. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee and ankle safety, mindful progression into the backbend, and proper spinal alignment.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Ankle Safety > Depth of Backbend
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee and ankle joints from strain. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with highly flexible quadriceps and ankles. If the AI detects knee or ankle pain, or pinching in the lower back, it should prompt the student to back off, use modifications (e.g., bolster support), or practice preparatory stretches.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Hero's Pose (Virasana) or Laghu Vajrasana. It is often followed by Child's Pose as a counter-stretch or Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, ankle, hip, or back injuries. Always use proper knee cushioning (blanket) and listen to the body for any signs of strain.
