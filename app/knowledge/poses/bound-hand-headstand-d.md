# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Inverted Lotus & Hip Opening
Baddha Hasta Sirsasana D aims for a deep inverted hip opening (Lotus) while maintaining balance in headstand with bound hands. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck, knee, and ankle safety, emphasize strong forearm and core engagement, and encourage a controlled, gradual formation of the Lotus.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Base & Core Engagement > Lotus Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a strong, stable base with the forearms and to use core and shoulder strength for stability. If the AI detects instability, neck strain, or improper hand/head placement, it should immediately prompt the student to lower down and reassess, or practice against a wall. The depth of the Lotus is secondary to safety.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Baddha Hasta Sirsasana C. It is often a final expression before returning to a grounded pose or Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced inversion and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute neck, shoulder, or spinal injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during menstruation/pregnancy. Always learn from a qualified teacher and use a wall for safety.
