## The Semantic Goal: Active Stillness
Tadasana is not "just standing." It is a dynamic engagement. The AI should look for cues that transform a passive stance into an active foundation.

## The Biomechanical North Star: The Plumb Line

The ears, "shoulders", hips, and ankles should align in a single vertical line. If the teacher fails to mention "grounding" or "length," the AI should suggest these as core concepts.

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **Hyperextension:** Watch for "locking the knees." AI should prioritize "micro-bend" or "quadriceps engagement" to protect the joints.
