# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Sit tall with legs extended forward."
    - "Flex the feet and engage the thighs."
    - "Press the palms into the floor beside the hips."
  foundation: 
    - "Root down through the sitting bones; distribute weight evenly."
    - "Flex the ankles (dorsiflexion) so the toes point toward the sky."
  alignment: 
    - "Stack the shoulders directly over the hips."
    - "Draw the navel in and up; broaden the collarbones."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen the spine from tailbone to crown; exhale to ground the thighs toward the earth."

    title: "Shoulder Stacking"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Stand beside the student and gently guide their shoulders back to stack over the hips if they are leaning forward."
    safety_check: "Do not push the student; use light directional cues."
  - id: "dandasana-spine-lengthening"
    title: "Crown Traction"
    type: "traction"
    instruction: "Gently place a hand on the upper back and encourage the student to reach the crown of the head toward your other hand held above them."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: The Golden Pillar
Dandasana is about finding the 90-degree axis. The vibe is immovable strength and structural clarity—it is the Mountain Pose (Tadasana) of the seated world.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Vertical Spine over Neutral Pelvis
The non-negotiable is the elimination of posterior pelvic tilt. If the student is 'sitting on their tailbone' with a rounded lower back, the AI must prioritize elevating the hips on a blanket over straightening the legs.

## Transition Logic
Dandasana serves as the 'neutral' starting point for almost all seated twists and forward folds. Transitioning requires a re-establishment of the 'L' shape before moving into the next plane of motion.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For students with tight hamstrings, a micro-bend in the knees is essential to prevent the pelvis from being pulled into a tilt. For those with wrist issues, palms can face backward or the student can rest on their fists.
