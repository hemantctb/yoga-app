## The Semantic Goal: Integrated Extension

The AI should prioritize the **Diagonal Line**. If the top arm is "lazy" or the back foot is lifting, the pose loses its "Extended" quality.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee-to-Arm Leverage
The contact between the front leg and the bottom arm is a tool for rotation. AI should look for cues that use this "binding" to turn the heart open.

## Transition Logic
- **From Warrior II:** The movement involves a deep reach forward *before* the lateral tilt. AI should check for the "Reach, then Pivot" sequence.

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **Shoulder Health:** If the student has shoulder pain, suggest "top hand to hip" to focus on the leg strength and heart rotation without the overhead reach.
