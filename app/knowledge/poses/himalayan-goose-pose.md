# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Ultimate Inverted Hip Opening & Core Control
Karandavasana is a pinnacle pose integrating extreme hip flexibility with advanced arm balance skills and profound core control in an inverted position. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck, knee, and hip safety, emphasize maximum arm and core engagement, and encourage a slow, controlled descent of the Lotus-bound legs.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Forearm Base & Core Control > Descent Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a strong, stable base with the forearms and to use powerful core strength for a controlled descent of the legs. If the AI detects instability, strain in the neck/hips/knees, or weak arm/core engagement, it should prompt the student to come out of the pose and reassess, or work on preparatory poses.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Pincha Mayurasana. It is often a final expression before returning to a grounded pose or Savasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an extremely advanced pose and is not suitable for beginners or individuals with any hip, knee, ankle, neck, wrist, elbow, or shoulder injuries. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely and should only be attempted under expert guidance. Listen to the body, and do not force entry.
