# IDENTITY
names:
  sanskrit: "Gomukhasana B"
  english: "Cow Face Pose B"
  phonetic: "go-moo-KAHS-ah-nah B"

# HERO DESCRIPTION
description: "Building on Gomukhasana A, this variation adds a forward fold over the stacked legs, intensifying the hip and shoulder opening while promoting spinal decompression and deep introspection. It calms the nervous system and aids in releasing deep-seated tension."

# METADATA
category: ["seated", "hip-opener", "shoulder-opener", "forward-bend"]
difficulty_level: "intermediate"
drishti: "nose-tip"

# WEIGHTED IMPACT
impact:
  chakras:
    primary: "svadishtana"
    secondary: ["muladhara", "anahata"]
  physical: 
    - "Intensifies the stretch in the outer hips, glutes, and piriformis."
    - "Deepens the stretch in the shoulders and upper arms."
    - "Lengthens the spine and encourages abdominal compression, stimulating organs."
  mental: 
    - "Calms the mind and nervous system, relieving stress and anxiety."
    - "Promotes emotional release through deeper hip opening."

# PROPS & GUIDANCE
props: ["strap", "blanket", "block"]
prop_guidance:
  - prop: "strap"
    purpose: "Shoulder Bind Assistance"
    instruction: "Use a strap to bridge the gap between your hands if you cannot comfortably clasp them behind your back during the shoulder bind."
  - prop: "blanket"
    purpose: "Pelvic Elevation"
    instruction: "Sit on a folded blanket to elevate the hips, making it easier to stack the knees and allowing for a longer spine in the forward fold."
  - prop: "block"
    purpose: "Head Support"
    instruction: "Place a block under your forehead if it doesn't comfortably reach the floor in the forward fold, to encourage relaxation."

# FLOW LOGIC

  predecessors: ["cow-face-pose-a"]
  successors: ["cow-face-pose-c", "seated-forward-bend"]

# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "From Gomukhasana A (knees stacked, bind if possible)."
    - "Fold forward over the stacked knees, keeping spine long."
    - "Relax head and neck, breathing into the hips."
  foundation: 
    - "Ensure both sitting bones are equally grounded, adjusting hips or using a blanket if needed."
    - "Maintain the integrity of the knee stack; do not force the top knee down."
  alignment: 
    - "Inhale to lengthen the spine, then exhale to hinge from the hips, leading with the chest."
    - "Keep the shoulders relaxed and drawn down the back, even with the bind."
    - "Allow the head to release toward the floor, or rest it on a prop."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen, exhale to deepen the fold and release tension."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["force knees", "pain", "round back", "shrug shoulders"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Put your head to your knees."
      elevated: "Allow the crown of the head to gravitate toward the stacked knees, facilitating a profound release in the hips and spine."

# ASSISTS (Hands-On)
assists:
  - id: "cow-face-pose-b-hip-release"
    title: "Pelvic Engagement & Release"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand behind the student. Place hands on the outer hips and gently encourage the top knee to settle down, aligning the pelvis, then gently press down on the sacrum as they fold forward."
    safety_check: "Avoid pressing directly on the knee joint; communicate about intensity and any sharp pain."
  - id: "cow-face-pose-b-spinal-lengthening"
    title: "Spinal Traction"
    type: "traction"
    instruction: "Place one hand on the sacrum and the other lightly on the upper back, encouraging length through the spine as the student folds forward."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student is not rounding the lower back excessively; emphasize spinal integrity."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Hip & Shoulder Release with Forward Fold
Gomukhasana B integrates the deep hip and shoulder opening of Gomukhasana A with a forward fold, intensifying the stretch and promoting deeper introspection. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee and shoulder safety, mindful progression into the fold, and maintaining spinal length.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee & Hip Safety > Depth of Fold
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee joints from strain. If the AI detects knee pain, excessive hip tilting, or forced shoulder binding, it should prompt the student to use props (blanket, block, strap) or reduce the intensity of the hip stack or forward fold.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Gomukhasana A. It is often followed by other seated variations or a return to Dandasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, hip, or shoulder injuries. Use props generously to support the hips and knees. Never force the knees to stack or the body into the forward fold if there is pain.
