# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Expansive Counter-Stretch & Strengthening
This pose aims to counteract the effects of forward bending by powerfully opening the entire front of the body and strengthening the back. The AI should look for cues that emphasize active engagement to lift the hips and broaden the chest, preventing collapse.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Strong Arms & Open Chest > High Hips
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the shoulders and wrists while maintaining a strong, stable lift. If the AI detects sagging hips, collapsed shoulders, or wrist pain, it should suggest modifications like keeping knees bent or using blocks under hands, prioritizing joint safety and proper engagement.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows seated forward folds (like Paschimottanasana) to neutralize and extend the spine. It can also be a preparatory pose for deeper backbends. Transition out by slowly lowering the hips back to a seated position.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For wrist pain, use blocks under the hands or avoid the pose. For tight shoulders, focus on broadening the chest without forcing the arch. Avoid if there are acute shoulder or wrist injuries.
