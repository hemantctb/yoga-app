# PROPS & GUIDANCE
props: ["wall", "block"]
prop_guidance:
  - prop: "wall"
    purpose: "Stability Coaching"
    instruction: "Place the soles of the feet against a wall to provide a grounding force and ensure the legs stay fully engaged."
  - prop: "block"
    purpose: "Wrist Support"
    instruction: "Place a block under the supporting hand if the floor feels too far away in modified versions, or to change the angle of the wrist."

# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Stack your top foot over the bottom foot."
    - "Press the floor away to lift the hips toward the sky."
    - "Extend the top arm vertically, stacking the shoulders."
  foundation: 
    - "Spread the fingers of the supporting hand wide, rooting into the knuckles."
    - "Firmly seal the outer edge of the bottom foot into the mat."
  alignment: 
    - "Engage the obliques to prevent the hips from sagging toward the floor."
    - "Draw the supporting shoulder blade down the back to stabilize the joint."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to expand the chest and reach upward; exhale to contract the core and find stability."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["sink", "hang", "slump", "lock"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Lift your hips."
      elevated: "Lift your hips high to engage your deep core muscles."
    - basic: "Straighten your arm."
      elevated: "Engage your triceps and keep a tiny bend in your elbow to protect the joint."

# ASSISTS (Hands-On)
assists:
  - id: "side-plank-hips-alignment"
    title: "Hip Elevation Support"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Stand behind the student. Place hands on the sides of the waist and gently guide the hips upward to ensure they are in line with the shoulders and heels."
    safety_check: "Avoid lifting too abruptly; ensure the student's supporting shoulder is stable."
  - id: "side-plank-shoulders-deepening"
    title: "Shoulder Stacking"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Lightly touch the top shoulder to encourage it to roll back, ensuring the chest stays open and the shoulders are vertically aligned."
    safety_check: "Do not pull the top arm back; focus on the rotation of the torso."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Integrated Strength
The "vibe" of Side Plank is structural integrity. It is not just about staying up; it is about the body acting as a single, unyielding beam of energy, resisting gravity through total integration.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Shoulder-Wrist Vertical Alignment
The non-negotiable rule is **Vertical Stacking**. The supporting shoulder must stay directly over the supporting wrist. Misalignment here creates sheer force in the rotator cuff and excessive strain on the carpal tunnel. If stacking is impossible, the student must modify by dropping the bottom knee.

## Transition Logic
Commonly enters from *Plank Pose* by shifting weight onto one hand and rolling onto the outer edges of the feet. Transitions out by rolling back to *Plank* or stepping the top foot behind into *Wild Thing*.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For wrist sensitivity, students can perform the pose on the forearm. For beginners, the 'kickstand' modification (dropping the bottom knee) is the primary pathway to building the oblique strength necessary for the full expression. Avoid if there is an acute rotator cuff tear.
