# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Core Strength & Hip Compression
Bhujapidasana is about compressing the torso into the thighs while relying on significant arm and core strength for balance. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize strong abdominal engagement, proper placement of the legs on the arms, and a steady gaze.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Arm/Leg Connection > Height
The non-negotiable rule is the firm connection between the inner thighs and the upper arms/shoulders. If the AI detects the legs sliding off the arms or a lack of engagement, it should prompt the student to re-establish this connection, even if it means sacrificing height in the pose.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows deep hip openers and preparatory arm balances like Bakasana (Crow Pose). It can lead into more advanced arm balances or be a transition back to a seated forward fold.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with wrist, elbow, or shoulder injuries. Beginners should work on hip flexibility and core strength before attempting this pose. Practice with caution and listen to the body for any signs of strain.
