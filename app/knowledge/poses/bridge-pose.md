# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: The Strengthening Anchor
The vibe is foundational strength. The AI should look for 'collapsing' in the chest or 'splaying' knees which indicates a loss of muscular integrity.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee-Ankle Stack
The non-negotiable is the vertical alignment of the shins. If the heels are too far forward, it strains the knees; if too far back, it limits hip extension. The AI must prioritize 'Knees over Ankles.'

## Transition Logic
Bridge is often the gateway to Wheel (Urdhva Dhanurasana). If the student maintains a solid foundation and open shoulders here, the AI can suggest advancing. Out-transition must be a slow, vertebrae-by-vertebrae descent.

## Inclusivity & Safety
**Critical Warning:** Never turn the head in Bridge Pose as it can compress the cervical spine. For students with neck issues, use a blanket under the shoulders (head on floor) to preserve the natural curve.
