# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Radical Non-Doing
The goal is the cessation of all activity—physical, mental, and verbal. The AI should monitor for 'micro-movements' (fidgeting) which indicate a nervous system still in 'fight or flight' mode.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Neutral Equilibrium
The non-negotiable is a neutral spine and open joints. If the feet are forced to point up or the chin is jutting toward the ceiling, the body cannot enter the parasympathetic state.

## Transition Logic
Savasana is always the final destination. The transition out must be incredibly slow: wiggling fingers/toes, a full-body stretch, and rolling to the right side (the solar/energizing side) before sitting up.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For students with high anxiety or PTSD, closing the eyes may feel unsafe; offer the option of a soft downward gaze. For pregnancy (second/third trimester), Savasana should be performed lying on the left side with a bolster between the knees to avoid vena cava compression.
