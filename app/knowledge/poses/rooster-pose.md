# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Arm Balance from Deep Hip Opening
Kukkutasana is an advanced arm balance that combines the deep hip opening of Lotus Pose with significant upper body and core strength. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize a stable Lotus, strong arm engagement, and a lifted core, while ensuring hip and wrist safety.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Lotus & Core Engagement > Height
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a stable and pain-free Lotus Pose before attempting the arm balance. If the AI detects knee pain, wrist strain, or a lack of core engagement, it should prompt the student to release the Lotus or use blocks for hand support.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Garbha Pindasana as the arms are already threaded through the legs. It can also be entered directly from Padmasana. It is often followed by a return to Lotus or a seated counter-pose.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose requiring extreme hip flexibility and strong upper body/core. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with any knee, hip, wrist, elbow, or shoulder injuries. Prioritize joint safety over achieving the full expression.
