# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Detoxifying Twist & Balanced Squat
Pasasana aims to provide a profound detoxifying spinal twist while maintaining balance and strength in a deep squat. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee safety, spinal length before twisting, and gradual, mindful progression into the bind.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length & Knee Safety > Twist Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a long, neutral spine throughout the twist and to protect the knees in the deep squat. If the AI detects rounding in the back, knee pain, or forced binding, it should suggest modifications (e.g., block under heels, strap for bind), prioritizing joint health and spinal integrity.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory standing poses like Malasana or Chair Pose. It requires careful setup and mindful execution. Transition out by releasing the bind, unwinding the torso, and slowly rising to standing.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose and should be approached with caution. Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, ankle, hip, or spinal injuries. Avoid deep twists during pregnancy. Use props (blocks under heels) to ensure stability if balance is challenging.
