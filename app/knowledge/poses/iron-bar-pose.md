# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Kneel, extend one leg to the side."
    - "Reach down with one hand, up and over with the other."
    - "Lengthen through the side body, opening the chest."
  foundation: 
    - "Keep the kneeling shin and foot firmly grounded."
    - "Ensure the extended leg is straight and rooted through the heel."
  alignment: 
    - "Reach the bottom hand down the extended leg (shin, ankle, or floor/block)."
    - "Extend the top arm up and over the ear, creating one long line of energy."
    - "Roll the top shoulder back, opening the chest toward the sky."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen the spine, exhale to deepen the lateral stretch."

    - basic: "Stretch your side."
      elevated: "Create a profound arc of energy along the entire lateral line of the body, allowing the intercostal spaces to expand with each breath."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Lateral Body Opening & Spinal Flexibility
Parighasana aims for a deep lateral stretch that opens the entire side body and improves spinal flexibility. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage length through the spine, active engagement of the core, and a gradual, controlled deepening of the side bend.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length & Open Chest > Deep Reach
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a long, neutral spine and to open the chest, rather than collapsing forward. If the AI detects rounding in the back, shoulder shrugging, or strain in the neck, it should suggest using a block for the bottom hand, reducing the depth of the stretch, or focusing on lengthening.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory kneeling poses or gentle spinal movements like Cat-Cow. It is often followed by other standing or kneeling poses that emphasize core strength and flexibility.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, hip, or spinal injuries. Use a blanket under the kneeling knee for comfort. Avoid if there is sharp pain in the side body or neck.
