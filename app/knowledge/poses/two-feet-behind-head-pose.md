# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Extreme Hip Opening & Deep Introspection
Dwipada Sirsasana is an advanced pose aiming for extreme bilateral external hip rotation and a unique, deeply introspective posture. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure hip, knee, and neck safety, gradual and mindful entry, and maintaining spinal length throughout the pose.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip & Knee Safety > Achieving Pose
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee and hip joints from strain. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with highly developed, pain-free hip flexibility. If the AI detects any pain in the knees, hips, or neck, it should immediately prompt the student to release the pose and work on preparatory hip openers.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Ekapada Sirsasana variations or deep seated hip openers like Kurmasana. It is a preparatory pose for Yoga Nidrasana.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an extremely advanced pose and is not suitable for beginners or individuals with any hip, knee, ankle, or neck injuries. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely. Listen to the body, and do not force entry.
