# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Primitive Release
The "vibe" of Lizard is one of ancient, deep release. It requires a shedding of physical armor around the pelvis to access the deep psoas and emotional center.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Spine Long > Forearms Down
The non-negotiable rule is **axial extension over depth**. Students frequently round the thoracic spine excessively to reach the floor with their forearms. The AI must prioritize a flat, long back using blocks over the "achievement" of touching the mat.

## Transition Logic
Lizard is a gateway pose. It is often the peak of a hip-opening sequence. Transition out by stepping back to *Downward-Dog* or *Plank-Pose*, or transition deeper by moving into *Pigeon Pose*.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For students with labral tears or hip impingement, keep the torso upright on hands rather than forearms. If the back knee is sensitive, always emphasize a blanket or tucking the back toes to engage the quad and lift the kneecap.
