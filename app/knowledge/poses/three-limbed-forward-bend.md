# HERO DESCRIPTION
description: "A seated forward fold that intensely stretches one hamstring while deeply bending the opposite knee, offering a unique stretch for the quadriceps and knee joint. It promotes spinal lengthening and mental focus."

# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "One leg extended, the other bent with foot outside hip."
    - "Fold forward from the hips over the extended leg."
    - "Keep your spine long and chest open."
  foundation: 
    - "Ensure both sitting bones are grounded; sit on a blanket if necessary."
    - "The bent knee's foot is next to the hip, not under it, with the heel pointing toward the hip."
  alignment: 
    - "Keep the extended leg active, quadriceps engaged, and foot flexed."
    - "Lead with the heart as you fold, avoiding rounding the back."
    - "Square your shoulders towards the extended leg."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen the spine, exhale to deepen the fold."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["pain", "force", "round back", "lift sitting bone"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Put your head on your knee."
      elevated: "Allow the crown of your head to draw toward the extended foot, maintaining length through your spine."

    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Place hands on the student's hips, ensuring both sitting bones remain grounded. Gently guide the torso to square over the extended leg."

    title: "Spinal Lengthening"
    type: "traction"
    instruction: "Place one hand on the sacrum and the other lightly on the upper back, encouraging axial extension on the exhale."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student is not rounding the lower back excessively; emphasize length over depth."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Asymmetrical Hamstring & Quad Stretch
This pose aims to provide a deep, asymmetrical stretch to the hamstring of one leg and the quadriceps/knee of the other. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure knee safety and spinal integrity, allowing for a deep but sustainable stretch.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee Safety & Spinal Length
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee joint of the bent leg and avoid rounding the lower back excessively. If the AI detects knee pain or significant lumbar rounding, it should suggest using a blanket under the hips or the bent knee, or lessening the depth of the forward fold.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Dandasana or other seated preparations. It is often followed by a neutral seated pose or a seated forward bend. Always practice on both sides for equal duration.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute knee injuries. If there is any pain in the bent knee, the student should modify by placing a blanket or prop under the knee, or avoiding the pose. Micro-bend the extended knee if hamstrings are very tight.
