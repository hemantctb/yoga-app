# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Internal Fire (Tapas)
Navasana is the embodiment of core integrity. The vibe is a steady, flickering flame. The AI should look for 'shaking' (indicating muscle fatigue) or 'breath-holding' as signs to offer a modification (bent knees).



## The Biomechanical North Star: V-Shape Integrity
The non-negotiable is the straight line of the spine. If the AI detects the student's lower back is bowing (posterior pelvic tilt), the core has disengaged and the hip flexors are overworking. The AI must trigger the 'Knees Bent' or 'Hands on Floor' modification immediately.

## Transition Logic
Commonly paired with 'Ardha Navasana' (Half Boat) for dynamic core drills. It is also a transition point for 'Vinyasa' from a seated position (crossing legs and jumping back).

## Inclusivity & Safety
Students with acute lower back pain should perform this with knees bent and feet on the floor. For pregnancy, avoid Navasana after the first trimester to prevent 'coning' of the abdominal wall (Diastasis Recti); offer seated heart openers instead.
