# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Enhanced Headstand Balance & Strength
Mukta Hasta Sirsasana A aims to build greater independent strength in the neck, shoulders, and core by reducing direct arm support compared to the traditional interlaced grip headstand. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck and shoulder safety, emphasize strong hand and core engagement, and encourage a controlled, gradual lift.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Strong Shoulders & Core > Kicking Up
The non-negotiable rule is to establish a strong, stable base with open hands and to use core and shoulder strength for lifting, rather than kicking up. If the AI detects instability, neck strain, or improper hand/head placement, it should immediately prompt the student to lower down and reassess, or practice against a wall.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows regular Headstand (Sirsasana) and preparatory arm/shoulder strengthening poses. It is a preparatory pose for Mukta Hasta Sirsasana B.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced inversion and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with acute neck, shoulder, or spinal injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during menstruation/pregnancy. Always learn from a qualified teacher and use a wall for safety.
