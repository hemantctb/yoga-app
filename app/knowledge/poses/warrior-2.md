## The Semantic Goal: Unwavering Presence
The balance between **Effort (Sthira)** in the legs and **Ease (Sukha)** in the gaze.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Vertical Spine
Ensure the teacher is not letting the torso 'lean' toward the front hand. The spine must remain perfectly vertical.

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **ACL Protection:** Prioritize the cue of 'tracking the knee toward the pinky toe' to avoid internal rotation of the front femur.
