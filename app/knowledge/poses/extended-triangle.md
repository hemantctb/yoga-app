## The Semantic Goal: Linear Expansion
The pose is a "reach in four directions." AI should prioritize the **Obliques** (Strength) and **Hamstrings** (Stretch).

## The Biomechanical North Star: Lateral Plane Integrity
The torso must stay in line with the legs. If the teacher suggests "touching the floor" at the cost of the torso leaning forward, flag it as an alignment error.

## Transition Logic
- **The Shift:** From Warrior II, listen for the "Straighten and Shift" cue—straightening the front leg and sending the hips back toward the rear heel.

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **Neck Safety:** Turning the head for the drishti can cause jaw clenching. Suggest a jaw-release cue.
- **Micro-bends:** Essential for hypermobile knees to engage the muscles rather than locking the joint.
