# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Internal Harvest
The vibe of Halasana is the "Plough." Just as a plough turns the earth to prepare it for new growth, this pose turns the senses inward, harvesting the energy built during the practice and preparing the mind for silence.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Thoracic Lifting > Lumbar Flexion
The non-negotiable rule is protecting the neck. If the shoulders are not grounded and the spine is rounding excessively into the neck, the pose is unsafe. The lifting of the sit bones and the engagement of the legs are required to keep the weight on the shoulders rather than the cervical vertebrae.

## Transition Logic
Almost exclusively follows *Salamba Sarvangasana* (Shoulder Stand). Exit by slowly rolling down vertebrae by vertebrae, using the core to brake the movement, or transition into *Karnapidasana* (Ear Pressure Pose).

## Inclusivity & Safety
**CRITICAL:** Students must never turn their head while in the pose. Modifications include "Half Plow" with feet on a chair or wall. Avoid if the student has glaucoma, high blood pressure, or acute neck injuries.
