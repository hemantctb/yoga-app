## The Semantic Goal: Controlled Descent
Chaturanga is about resisting gravity. The AI should look for cues that emphasize **eccentric control** and core engagement over just "getting down."

## The Biomechanical North Star: The 90-Degree Rule

If the shoulders dip lower than the elbows, it places dangerous stress on the anterior capsule of the shoulder. AI must prioritize the "Shift forward" and "Stop at 90 degrees" cues.

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **Knees-Down:** Always encourage the "Knees, Chest, Chin" or "Knees-down Chaturanga" as the primary way to build strength without compromising shoulder health.
