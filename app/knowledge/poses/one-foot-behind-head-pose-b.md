# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Extreme Flexibility & Arm Balance Integration
Ekapada Sirsasana B aims to integrate extreme hip flexibility with advanced arm balance strength. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure hip, knee, and neck safety, emphasize strong arm and core engagement, and encourage a controlled, mindful lift into the balance.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Stable Foot Behind Head & Strong Arms > Lift Height
The non-negotiable rule is to have the foot securely and comfortably behind the head, and to use strong, engaged arms and core for the lift. If the AI detects instability, strain in the neck/hips/knees, or weak arm engagement, it should prompt the student to lower down and reassess, or work on preparatory poses.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Ekapada Sirsasana A. It is a preparatory pose for Ekapada Sirsasana C.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an extremely advanced pose and is not suitable for beginners or individuals with any hip, knee, ankle, neck, wrist, elbow, or shoulder injuries. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely. Listen to the body, and do not force entry.
