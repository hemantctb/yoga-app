# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Spinal Decompression & Internalization
Karnapidasana aims for an intense spinal stretch, abdominal compression, and deep introspection. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure neck safety, gradual deepening of the fold, and a sense of calm surrender, especially given the inverted nature.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Neck Safety & Spinal Decompression > Depth
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the cervical spine. If the AI detects neck compression, lifting of the shoulders, or an inability to breathe freely, it should prompt the student to back off, use more blankets under the shoulders, or release the pose. The weight must be on the shoulders, not the neck.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Halasana (Plow Pose) in most Ashtanga sequences. It is often followed by Matsyasana (Fish Pose) as a counter-stretch.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an intermediate to advanced inversion and should be approached with caution. Not suitable for individuals with acute neck or shoulder injuries, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or during pregnancy. Always use blankets under the shoulders to protect the neck. Never turn the head in this pose.
