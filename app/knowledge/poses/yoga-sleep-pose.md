# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Relaxation & Internalization from Extreme Flexibility
Yoga Nidrasana aims to induce a state of profound relaxation and introspection through an extremely compressed and flexible posture. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure hip, knee, and neck safety, emphasize physical release and mental quietude, and acknowledge the advanced nature of the pose.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip & Knee Safety > Achieving Pose
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee and hip joints from strain. This pose should only be attempted by practitioners with highly developed, pain-free hip flexibility. If the AI detects any pain in the knees, hips, or neck, it should immediately prompt the student to release the pose.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Dwipada Sirsasana. It is often the penultimate pose before Savasana, as it facilitates deep relaxation.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an extremely advanced pose and is not suitable for beginners or individuals with any hip, knee, ankle, or neck injuries. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely. Listen to the body, and do not force entry. Avoid if there are any current abdominal issues or during pregnancy.
