# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Sit with one leg extended, the other bent with foot near hip."
    - "Wrap arm around bent knee and bind behind back."
    - "Fold forward over the extended leg."
  foundation: 
    - "Root down through both sitting bones; sit on a blanket if necessary."
    - "Bent foot flat on the floor, about a fist-width from the hip."
  alignment: 
    - "Inhale to lengthen the spine, then exhale to twist and bind."
    - "Lead with the chest as you fold, keeping the spine long."
    - "Keep the extended leg active, foot flexed."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen, exhale to deepen the twist and fold."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING

    - basic: "Pull your shoulder back."
      elevated: "Rotate the leading shoulder internally to facilitate the bind, maintaining integrity in the joint."

    title: "Shoulder Opening"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand behind the student. Gently guide the binding arm further around, encouraging the shoulder to open and the hands to clasp."
    safety_check: "Avoid forcing the bind; ensure there's no pain in the shoulder or wrist."
  - id: "marichyasana-a-spinal-lengthening"
    title: "Spinal Traction"
    type: "traction"
    instruction: "Place one hand on the sacrum and the other on the upper back, encouraging axial extension on the exhale."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student is not rounding the lower back excessively; emphasize length over depth."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Spinal Rotation with Hamstring Stretch
Marichyasana A aims to combine a spinal twist and shoulder bind with a hamstring stretch. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure spinal length, safe binding, and a mindful forward fold.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Spinal Length & Shoulder Safety
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a long spine before and during the twist and forward fold, and to avoid forcing the shoulder bind. If the AI detects rounding in the back or shoulder pain, it should suggest using a strap for the bind or reducing the depth of the forward fold.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Dandasana or other seated preparations. It is often followed by other seated forward folds or twists. Always practice on both sides for equal duration.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for individuals with acute knee, shoulder, or lower back injuries. Use a strap if the bind is not accessible. Sit on a blanket to help with hip alignment and spinal length.
