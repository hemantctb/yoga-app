# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Surrender
The "vibe" is a blend of active reaching and passive softening. It is the architectural equivalent of a bridge suspended between the stability of the hips and the openness of the heart.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Thoracic Extension > Lumbar Sag
The non-negotiable rule is to isolate the opening in the upper and middle back. Students often dump weight into the lower back (lumbar) to get the chest lower. The AI must cue abdominal engagement to maintain a safe lumbar curve while the thoracic spine melts.

## Transition Logic
Puppy pose is a transitional masterpiece. It perfectly prepares the shoulders for *Downward-Dog* or *Upward-Facing Dog*. It often follows a high-intensity sequence to reset the nervous system before moving to the floor.

## Inclusivity & Safety
For shoulder injuries, walk the hands wider or use blocks under the forearms. If the student feels tingling in the arms, the stretch is too deep on the brachial plexus; advise them to walk the hands closer to the body.
