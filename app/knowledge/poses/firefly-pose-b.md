# IDENTITY
names:
  sanskrit: "Tittibhasana B"
  english: "Firefly Pose B"
  phonetic: "tit-tee-BAHS-ah-nah B"

# HERO DESCRIPTION
description: "An advanced arm balance that builds upon Tittibhasana A, where the extended legs are then brought closer together and often lifted higher. It further challenges hamstring and inner thigh flexibility, demanding intense upper body and core strength, and profound balance."

# METADATA

  physical: 
    - "Intensifies strengthening of the arms, wrists, shoulders, and core muscles."
    - "Deepens the stretch in hamstrings and inner thighs."
    - "Refines balance, coordination, and body awareness in a highly compact form."
  mental: 
    - "Cultivates profound focus, determination, and mental resilience."
    - "Enhances body-mind connection and builds self-confidence."

    purpose: "Hand Elevation"
    instruction: "Place blocks under your hands to elevate the floor, which can provide extra height and make it easier to lift and extend the legs."

# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "From Tittibhasana A, bring legs closer together."
    - "Keep legs straight and strong, core engaged."
    - "Maintain balance on hands, gaze steady."
  foundation: 
    - "Requires a stable Tittibhasana A with sufficient hamstring and inner thigh flexibility."
    - "Hands firmly planted, fingers spread wide, gripping the mat."
  alignment: 
    - "Hug the legs tightly around the upper arms/shoulders."
    - "Engage your core deeply to lift the pelvis and extend the legs."
    - "Keep your legs straight and strong, pressing out through the heels and inner edges of the feet."
  breath_instruction: "Breathe deeply and smoothly, using the breath to sustain the lift and balance."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["drop", "collapse", "strain wrists", "jerk legs"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Bring your legs together."
      elevated: "Draw the inner lines of the legs toward each other, consolidating energy at the core and refining the balance."

# ASSISTS (Hands-On)
assists:
  - id: "firefly-pose-b-hips-lift"
    title: "Pelvic Elevation"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand beside the student. Place hands under their hips and gently assist in lifting the pelvis, helping them refine the lift and leg position."
    safety_check: "Ensure the student is actively engaging their core and arms; do not lift them entirely."
  - id: "firefly-pose-b-leg-integration"
    title: "Inner Thigh Engagement"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Gently cue the student to squeeze their legs together and hug their upper arms, creating a more compact and stable form."
    safety_check: "Avoid any forceful manipulation; ensure no pain in the hip, knee, or ankle."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Refined Hamstring Length & Arm Balance Control
Tittibhasana B aims to refine the arm balance by drawing the extended legs closer together, demanding even greater hamstring and inner thigh flexibility, along with precision and control. The AI should prioritize cues that ensure wrist and hip safety, emphasize strong arm and core engagement, and encourage a precise, controlled leg position.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Strong Base & Hamstring Length > Leg Position
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain a strong, stable base with the hands and to have sufficient hamstring and inner thigh flexibility to bring the legs closer without rounding the spine or straining the wrists. If the AI detects instability, wrist strain, or excessive spinal rounding, it should prompt the student to lower down, use blocks for hand support, or work on preparatory poses.

## Transition Logic
Directly follows Tittibhasana A. It is a preparatory pose for Tittibhasana C.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an extremely advanced arm balance and should be approached with extreme caution. Not suitable for beginners or individuals with any wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, or hamstring injuries. It requires years of dedicated practice to achieve safely. Listen to the body, and do not force entry.
