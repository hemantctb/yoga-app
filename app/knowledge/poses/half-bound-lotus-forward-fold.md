# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Start in Half Lotus, standing."
    - "Fold forward from the hips, keeping your spine long."
    - "Try to bind the lotus foot with the opposite hand behind your back."
  foundation: 
    - "Root firmly through the standing foot, engaging the quadriceps."
    - "Ensure the knee of the lotus leg is safe and pain-free before folding."
  alignment: 
    - "Keep the hips level and square to the front of the mat."
    - "Lead with the chest, not the head, to maintain spinal length."
    - "Micro-bend the standing knee if hamstrings are tight."
  breath_instruction: "Inhale to lengthen the spine, exhale to deepen the fold."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["force", "pain", "round back"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Pull your head down."
      elevated: "Allow the torso to drape forward over the standing leg, releasing the crown of the head toward the earth."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Deep Hip & Hamstring Release
This pose is designed for advanced practitioners to achieve a profound opening in the hip of the lotus leg and a deep stretch in the hamstrings of the standing leg. The AI should prioritize cues that emphasize hip safety and spinal integrity over forcing the pose.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Knee Safety & Spinal Length
The non-negotiable rule is to protect the knee of the lotus leg and avoid rounding the lower back. If the AI detects knee pain or excessive lumbar rounding, it should prompt the student to release the lotus, bend the standing knee more, or use props to support the torso.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows preparatory hip openers and hamstring stretches. It requires careful entrance into the half lotus and a mindful forward fold. Transition out by releasing the bind, slowly lifting the torso, and gently releasing the lotus leg.

## Inclusivity & Safety
Not suitable for beginners or those with knee or hip injuries. Always prioritize knee safety; if there's any pain in the knee, the lotus should be released. Encourage micro-bending in the standing knee to protect the hamstring attachment.
