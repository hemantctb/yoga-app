# IDENTITY
names:
  sanskrit: "Uttanasana"
  english: "Standing Forward Bend"
  phonetic: "oot-tan-AHS-uh-nuh"

# HERO DESCRIPTION
description: "A deep stretch and a powerful inversion that quiets the mind. It lengthens the entire back body and allows the heart to rest above the head, promoting calm and introspection."

# METADATA
category: ["forward-bend", "inversion"]
difficulty_level: "beginner"
drishti: "nose-tip"

# WEIGHTED IMPACT
impact:
  chakras:
    primary: "svadishtana"
    secondary: ["muladhara"]
  physical: 
    - "Stretches hamstrings, calves, and hips"
    - "Relieves tension in the neck and spine"
    - "Stimulates liver and kidneys"
  mental: 
    - "Reduces fatigue and anxiety"
    - "Soothes the nervous system"

# WEIGHTED ANATOMY
anatomy:
  strengthen:
    secondary: ["quadriceps"] # To facilitate hamstring release
  stretch:
    primary: ["hamstrings", "gastrocnemius", "erector_spinae"]
    secondary: ["gluteus_maximus", "soleus", "latissimus_dorsi"]
  stabilize:
    primary: ["transverse_abdominis"]
    secondary: ["pelvic_floor"]

# PROPS & GUIDANCE
props: ["block", "wall", "strap"]
prop_guidance:
  - prop: "block"
    purpose: "Bringing the Floor to You"
    instruction: "Place hands on blocks if the floor feels too far away. This prevents the spine from rounding excessively and keeps the weight in the balls of the feet."
  - prop: "wall"
    purpose: "Hip Alignment"
    instruction: "Stand with your sit-bones against a wall. As you fold, keep the contact to ensure your hips stay stacked over your ankles rather than leaning back."

# FLOW LOGIC

  predecessors: ["mountain-pose", "upward-salute"]
  successors: ["half-forward-bend", "plank-pose", "mountain-pose"]

assists:
  - id: "standing-forward-bend-sacrum-lift"
    title: "Hip Hinge Helper"
    type: "alignment"
    instruction: "Stand to the side. Place one hand on the lower belly and one on the sacrum. Guide the pelvis to tilt forward (anterior tilt) to deepen the fold."
    safety_check: "Ensure knees are micro-bent."

  - id: "standing-forward-bend-spine-release"
    title: "Spinal Waterfall"
    type: "deepening"
    instruction: "Stand to the side. Place a hand gently on the mid-back. On the exhale, smooth the hand down toward the neck to encourage releasing the head."
    safety_check: "Do not push down heavily."
# CUEING FRAMEWORK
cueing:
  summary: 
    - "Hinge at the hips, not the waist."
    - "Let the head hang heavy."
    - "Shift weight slightly into the balls of the feet."
  foundation: 
    - "Feet hip-width apart or big toes touching."
    - "Ground through the inner and outer edges of the feet."
  alignment: 
    - "Bend the knees as much as needed to touch the floor or blocks."
    - "Lift the sit-bones toward the sky."
    - "Release the crown of the head toward the mat."
  breath_instruction: "Exhale to fold deeper; inhale to find a micro-expansion in the back ribs."
  
  # VOCABULARY COACHING
  forbidden_words: ["Pull", "Force", "Snap"]
  elevated_vocabulary:
    - basic: "Touch your toes"
      elevated: "Fold your upper body over your thighs, letting gravity lengthen your spine."

# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Surrender

Uttanasana is about releasing tension. The AI should check if the teacher is encouraging "letting go" of the head and neck rather than "pulling" the body down.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Hip Hinging
If the student is rounding their lower back, they are not hinging at the hips. AI should prioritize cues about "knees bent" and "belly-to-thigh contact."

## Inclusivity & Safety
- **Dizziness:** Caution students with low blood pressure to rise slowly.
- **Hamstring Tears:** Always suggest a micro-bend in the knees to avoid pulling on the sit-bone attachments.
