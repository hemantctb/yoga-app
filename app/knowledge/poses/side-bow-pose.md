# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Enhanced Backbend, Lateral Stretch & Balance
Parsva Dhanurasana aims to intensify the backbend and quadriceps stretch of Bow Pose by adding a lateral roll, challenging balance and opening the side body. The AI should prioritize cues that encourage active kicking, chest opening, core engagement for stability, and a gentle, controlled roll to the side.

## The Biomechanical North Star: Active Legs & Stable Core > Deep Roll
The non-negotiable rule is to maintain the integrity of the backbend and protect the lower back while rolling to the side. If the AI detects a loss of control, collapse in the backbend, or strain in the lower back/neck, it should prompt the student to return to Bow Pose or Child's Pose.

## Transition Logic
Typically follows Dhanurasana. It is a challenging variation that requires significant backbend and core strength. It is often followed by Child's Pose as a counter-stretch or a gentle reclined twist.

## Inclusivity & Safety
This is an advanced pose and should be approached with caution. Not suitable for individuals with acute back or neck injuries, high blood pressure, or abdominal issues. Always listen to the body and avoid any sharp pain, especially in the spine or knees.
