# AI COACHING CONTEXT (Internal)
## The Semantic Goal: Heart Radiance
The essence of Camel is "fearless opening." The AI should look for signs of "retreat," such as the hips shifting back toward the heels or the shoulders hunching, and cue for expansion and forward energy.



## The Biomechanical North Star: Hips Over Knees
The non-negotiable is the vertical alignment of the thighs. If the hips drift back, the pose loses its leverage and places excessive strain on the lower back. The AI must prioritize "Thighs perpendicular to floor" above "Hands touching heels."

## Transition Logic
Camel is a high-intensity backbend. It must be followed by neutral spine positions (like Table Top) before moving into a counter-stretch like Child's Pose. Moving too quickly into a deep forward fold can cause spinal shock.

## Inclusivity & Safety
**Critical Warning:** Avoid if the student has recent back or neck injuries. For students with high blood pressure or vertigo, keep the chin tucked toward the chest rather than dropping the head back. If the heels feel too far away, tuck the toes under to elevate the heels.
